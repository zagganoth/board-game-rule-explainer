Vordt of the \nBoreal Valley is a mega boss, a powerful enemy players \ncan face after fighting through numerous encounters,  \na mini boss, and a main boss.\nThe vile watchdog of the Boreal V alley, Vordt is tasked with \nstanding sentinel over the gates that lead from the Undead \nSettlement to the Castle of Lothric. His only companions in \nthis unholy duty are the reanimated dead, hollow soldiers, \nand Lothric Knights, the living long since passed from this \nstill and broken place. Truly little sign of humanity remains \nto Vordt, who roams endlessly amongst the ranks of the dead, \nwreathed in icy mist.\nOnce an outrider knight in the service of the corrupt Pontiff \nSulyvahn, Vordt was driven to the depths of insanity by the \ngift of the Pontiff \u2019s Left Eye.

With a little careful attention, you can \nhave a gorgeous-looking force ready to take on \neverything the Wasteland can throw at you.  \nIf you have purchased the starter set in plastic, \nyour models are pre-assembled. If you have any  \nof the other sets in resin, read on!\nASSEMBLY FOR RESIN\n1. Wash sprues in lukewarm water,  \nwith a small amount of dish soap. \nAllow to dry fully.\n2. Remove each piece of the the model \nfrom the sprue using side clippers. \nSmall, delicate pieces can be removed \nwith a sharp scalpel instead.\n3. Remove mold line. Each piece of  \nthe model will have a raised line that \nruns around it (the mold line formed \nwhen the two halves of the mold are \npushed together). This needs to be \nremoved. You can scrape and slice  \nthem off using a sharp scalpel blade,  \nor alternatively file them off with a \nneedle file or emery board. Resin dust \ncan be hazardous, so ensure you wear \na face mask while filing, dampen your \ntools to reduce dust, and fully clean up \nyour working environment when done.\n4. Prepare glue surface. Score each  \nflat surface that will have glue applied \nin a hatched (criss-cross) pattern  \nwith a scalpel. This will increase the \nsurface area for gluing and ensure a \nstronger join. \n5. Apply glue. Apply a small amount of \nsuperglue (Cyanoacrylate glue) to each \narea to be joined. Immediately push \nthe two parts together and hold until \nsecurely bonded. You have a moment or \ntwo to tweak your pose before the glue \nsets. Less is more with superglue, so \nuse it sparingly to ensure a strong join.\nASSEMBLY FOR PVC\n1. Wash miniatures in lukewarm water \nwith a small amount of dish soap. \nAllow to dry. \n2. If any components have become \nbent, gently heat with a hair dryer \nand bend back into alignment.\n3. Using a sharp, clean scalpel, \nremove the mold line that runs \naround the model. This will need  \nto be gently sliced away from  \nthe model.\n4. If there are any remnants of the \nmold line, they can be removed \nusing a very fine emery board.\n5. If any components are loose or \nhave fallen off the model, they can \nbe glued back into place using \nsuperglue.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2400, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4d6bc518-0b26-4625-95f0-2a026bb5ec4e": {"__data__": {"id_": "4d6bc518-0b26-4625-95f0-2a026bb5ec4e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "69e04a3f-b579-4ac4-bf13-7cc086146a2b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "4", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "hash": "f5467b15dd2b27d059623ae290eea21947faa1906e728953413430b51d47f04e", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "FALLOUT \u2013 WASTELAND WARFARE4\n1.

All the paint and \nbrushes used were from The Army Painter. Feel \nfree to experiment using your own color mixes.\n1. Priming\nThe model is undercoated, or primed using a solid \nflat coat of a suitable color. This is done with Army \nPainter Spray Primers.\n2. Basecoat\nThe base colors are applied to each area of a model.  \nThe basecoat should be neat and smooth, and is \nbuilt up with several thin coats of paint. Use a \nmedium brush (size 2) to speed up painting and \nensure smooth coats.\n3. Wash\nShading is added to models using Army Painter \nwashes. These will run into the deeper recesses of  \na model and enhance the shadows of the model.  \nUse your medium brush again, to keep this fast  \nand smooth. \nHighlight\nLighter-colored paint is applied to the edges and \nraised areas of a model to further accentuate the \ndetails of the sculpt. Use a sharp pointed small \nbrush (size 1) to keep these crisp and tidy.\nWarpaints, Quickshade Washes and the rest of The Army Painter product range are the intellectual property of The Army Painter ApS \n\u2013 learn more about The Army Painters range of products at www.TheArmyPainter.com", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2800, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0c0d1970-41ec-4e57-aa04-a3c8fb5fe308": {"__data__": {"id_": "0c0d1970-41ec-4e57-aa04-a3c8fb5fe308", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "84ef524c-96c4-4205-8fc9-f99d938743d5", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "5", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "hash": "438a0c2bd5a39340c4ffacb15fbae95807fcf970c52988c92039a7c4ee1ec682", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "SECTION 1 \u2013 INTRODUCTION 5\n1.

If you\u2019ve \nalready worked through that booklet\u2019s tutorials, or \nfeel you don\u2019t need to, prepare for battle!\nYour force, which will belong to one of the Fallout \nfactions, is built from models and their related unit \ncards, using weapon cards and other item cards \nacquired along the way. During the game, players \ntake turns, using Actions to move, fire weapons, \nattack in combat and interact with the Wasteland \nitself. Attacks and skill use are both resolved \nthrough Skill Tests made with dice rolls.\nSkill Tests, along with the other mechanics of the \ngame, will be explained in the following chapters. \nYou\u2019ll start, as you might expect, with such things \nas measuring and movement, shooting and close \ncombat, damage and armor. You\u2019ll then progress to \nskill use and scavenging, tactical matters such as \nterrain, cover and prepared actions, before bringing \nout the big guns for advanced weapons, critical \nattacks and power armor.

Different models, characters \nand factions in the games may use different \nattributes for Skill Tests (dice rolls to determine \nif a model succeeds at a task \u2013 see p.10). For \nexample, while most models will use Perception \nfor ranged combat, others may use Agility or even \nStrength instead. \nStrength (Str)\nStrength is most often used to show how good \na model is at close combat, and how able they \nare with a Melee Weapon (a weapon specifically \ndesigned for close combat).\nPerception (Per)\nPerception is often used to show a model\u2019s ability \nwith a Ranged Weapon. It also affects how easily \nthey can detect dangers and react to enemy activity.\nEndurance (end)\nEndurance is most often used as the attribute that \nshows how tough a model is and how much damage \nit can take before dying. It sometimes indicates a \nmodel\u2019s ability with a Thrown Weapon. \nCharisma (Cha)\nCharisma is used for a variety \nof Skill Tests, and shows how \ncharming, intimidating, or \ncunning a model is.\nIntelligence (Int)\nIntelligence is used for \ninteracting with computer \nterminals, lock picking and  \nmany other Skill Tests. \nAgility (agI)\nAgility shows how nimble a \nmodel is. It is often used for \nThrown Weapons, and sometimes \nfor close combat or shooting. \nLuck (LuC)\nEspecially heroic models may use \nLuck to make near-miss attacks \nhit, or dodge potentially fatal \ndamage.\nMove Distance\nFallout: Wasteland Warfare uses range rulers  \nfor all measurements.

Next to these are icons representing skills \nthat correspond with those attributes.\nFor a Skill Test to succeed, the result (after any \nmodifications) must be equal to or lower than the \nSkill Value (the attribute number next to the icon). \nNote: Sometimes a specific attribute will be tested \nrather than a skill \u2013 in these cases, the result of the \nSkill Test must be equal to or lower than the value \nof the relevant attribute.\nBonuses and penalties adjust the Skill Value that \nthe player needs to roll equal to or less than. All \nmodifiers \u2013 bonuses and penalties \u2013 are totalled \nbefore being applied to the skill being used. If the \nadjusted Skill Value is less than 1, the roll only \nsucceeds if a  is rolled.\nExample: A Paladin using a weapon with a \ncomfort grip is firing at a target behind two \nitems of cover. The Paladin receives a +2 bonus \nto their Skill Value for the comfort grip, but a  \n-4 penalty for 2x cover (explained on page 17); \ntherefore, a total -2 modifier is applied to the \nrifle Skill Value of 7 for an adjusted Skill \nValue of 5. They need to make a Skill Roll of 5 \nor lower on the Skill Dice to be successful.\nSome dice results (especially from the green \nAccuracy Effect Dice) modify the Skill Dice roll. \nMinus numbers help achieve a lower (better) result, \nwith this modified total compared to the adjusted \nSkill Value.\nExample: The Paladin\u2019s adjusted \nSkill Value is 5. The Paladin rolls \nthe Skill Dice plus one Accuracy \nEffect Dice (due to the weapon he \nuses). The Skill Dice shows a 6 and \nthe Accuracy Effect Dice shows -2; \nthus, the adjusted Skill Test result is \n4 \u2013 below the adjusted skill and thus a success.\nIf the Skill Test fails, none of the effect icons count \napart from any Action Point icons on the Skill \nDice which are available to be used (Action Points \nare discussed later, on p.40).\nIf a X  is rolled on the Skill Dice, the Skill Test \nis always a failure and cannot be adjusted by \nnumerical bonuses.\nSome unit cards have abilities called Specialities. \nA model which has a Speciality receives +2 on any \nSkill Values when using the relevant item or skill \nwith which they have the Speciality.\nIf a model does not have a specific skill icon on their \nunit card, it cannot make a Skill Test of that type.\nOPPOSED SKILL TEST\nAn Opposed Skill Test occurs when a model \ntries to beat something that resists, usually \nanother model. To perform an Opposed Skill Test, \nall parties involved make rolls against the Skill \nValue(s) required. The highest successful  result \nwins. Note: the winning roll must be a success  \neven if the other parties involved do not have the \nrequisite skill, or all fail their rolls.

Effect Dice gained from the weapon, \nequipment, abilities, or perks (see the Campaign \nHandbook, p.5) may modify the Skill Test result.\nExample: If the Sole Survivor wants to fire \na plasma rifle (which has a Rifle icon on the \nweapon card), they will need a result of 7 or \nlower from their Skill Test for it to be a success.\nMaking a shooting Action\nTo make a Shoot Action using a Ranged Weapon \n(Pistol, Rifle or Heavy Weapon):\n1. The attacking model must have the relevant \nskill, and\n2. The target must be within the weapon\u2019s range, \nand\n3. The attacking model must have Line of Sight \nto the target.\nAs well as models, a target of combat can be an \nobject or specific point on the battlefield.\nRANGE\nFallout: Wasteland Warfare uses only two \nranges: short and long. Range is calculated using \nthe colored range rulers indicated by the weapon \ncard (below right), with short range on the left and \nlong range on the right. When measuring weapon \nrange, long range starts where short range ends so \nto measure the full range of a weapon, simply place \nthe two relevant range rulers together, end to end. \nSome weapons do not have a long range.\nWhen a shooting player makes their Skill Roll, they \nadd all the Effect Dice shown beneath the relevant \ntarget range on the weapon card. If a target\u2019s base \nfalls within both short and long range, the attacker \nmay choose which range to use.\nExample: The Sole Survivor is armed with  \nan assault rifle. When shooting at Super \nMutant A (see below), the target will be at \nshort range, so the player rolls the Skill Dice \nplus one Accuracy (green) Effect Dice and one \nDamage (black) Effect Dice. If the Sole Survivor \nfires at Super Mutant B, the target will be at \nlong range, requiring the roll of the Skill Dice \nplus one Damage (black) Effect Dice.\nSHORT RANGE LONG RANGE\nSHORT \nRANGE\nLONG \nRANGE", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2347, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "661c7700-9144-4561-b51f-ccbb4fa473cc": {"__data__": {"id_": "661c7700-9144-4561-b51f-ccbb4fa473cc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "253e30ad-6cac-4085-9781-828d2cec2e71", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "17", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "hash": "fe7d89949943341d60b0661d9179a05ce90bc73e73d85722fc793c8da5e4a27d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "SECTION 2 \u2013 LEAVING THE VAULT 17\nIn Example 3, above, the Knight Patrol is \nstanding on top of a desk, rather than standing \nbehind it.

Normal-sized models do not block LoS, but \nmay make it harder to hit your target (see below).\nCOVER\nWhile Line of Sight helps determine whether \nshooting a target is even possible, cover indicates \nwhether objects between shooter and target make  \na possible shot more difficult. To check for cover,  \na line is drawn (when viewed from above) from \nthe center of the shooter\u2019s base to the center  \nof the target\u2019s base. This is referred to as the  \nLine of Cover (LoC).\n n Each object that the Line of Cover fully  \npasses through (enters and exits) places a \ntemporary -2 cover modifier on the Skill \nValue of the attacker. Any cover which the \nshooter\u2019s base is touching is excluded.\n n Any shot affected by cover also increases the \ntarget\u2019s armor by 1. This increase is only \napplied once (before the effect of the shot is \nresolved) no matter how many items of cover \naffect the shot.\nIn Example 1, the crate does not block Line of \nSight so the Knight Patrol can shoot. The Line \nof Cover goes through the building and the crate \nbut the Knight Patrol ignores the building as its \nbase touches it. The value of the Knight Patrol\u2019s \nweapon skill is modified by -2 and the Super \nMutant\u2019s Armor Rating increases by 1. While \nthey share LoS, any shot returned by the Super \nMutant is resolved against a -4 modification of \nits weapon\u2019s Skill Value because of the crate and \nthe building), but the Knight Patrol\u2019s Armor \nRating still only increases by 1.\nNormal-sized models which are not friendly to the \nshooting model also give cover, determined by the \nlocation of their bases. Models on the shooter\u2019s own \nside do not give cover as they are working together.\nIn Example 2, Settler A is shooting at Knight \nPatrol 1 with Line of Sight, as Normal-sized \nmodels do not block LoS. Settler B is on the same \nside as Settler A, so does not count as cover \n(despite being along the LoS). If Knight Patrol 1 \nwere to return fire, Settler B is not on the same \nside as Knight Patrol 1, so does count as cover.\nA Line of Cover must fully pass through (that is, \nenter and exit) an object to give the benefit of cover. \nHUGE MODELS\nModels with bases of 60mm diameter or wider \nblock Line of Sight for any smaller models (as well \nas impeding movement as usual).

Damage from \na weapon is usually of a single type, but if more \nthan one type of damage is caused, each is resolved \nindividually using any relevant armor. \nEach weapon card states the base damage a \nweapon does on the left side of the card. Next to \nthis icon is the base damage of the weapon.\nAPPLYING DAMAGE\nThe sequence for applying damage is as follows:\n1. Check the base damage as shown on the \nweapon card (see above).\n2. When resolving the attack, some icons rolled on \nEffect Dice may indicate additional damage, as \nwell as other effects described on the weapon \ncard. For example, each  icon rolled on the \nDamage (black) Effect Dice usually adds  \n1 damage to the base damage of the weapon. \nSee also \u2018Special Effects\u2019, p.20. \n3. Armor and other effects may block some, or all, \ndamage from taking effect (see \u2018Armor\u2019, p.21).\n4. Each point of damage caused to a model which \nis not blocked is recorded by adding a Damage \nToken (see below) next to the model.\nDamage Tokens are double-sided, showing a \n\u2018Regular Damage Token\u2019 on one side (physical or \nenergy damage) and a Radiation Damage Token on \nthe other. Whichever side is showing, it represents \none point of damage.\nRecording Radiation Damage\nWhen a model takes radiation damage, each point \nis recorded by turning over one of the model\u2019s \nRegular Damage Tokens to the radiation damage \nside (see Example 1).\nIf there are not enough Regular Damage Tokens \nto turn over, turn over as many Regular Damage \nTokens as are available, then add one Radiation \nDamage Token for each addition point of radiation \ndamage yet to be applied (see Examples 2 and 3).\nHEALTH \nICON\nPHYSICAL \nDAMAGE \nICON\nENERGY \nDAMAGE \nICON\nRADIATION \nDAMAGE \nICON\nPHYSICAL/ ENERGY \nDAMAGE TOKEN\n(AKA \u2018REGULAR\u2019 \nDAMAGE TOKEN)\nRADIATION \nDAMAGE \nTOKEN", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2811, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "86bf25b6-8c3d-40df-9baa-159541e7cf6f": {"__data__": {"id_": "86bf25b6-8c3d-40df-9baa-159541e7cf6f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c8575e96-2db7-4f9c-b53c-709be44ab347", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "hash": "0dbbedecfed879ca5de34dc07f57e902db490dadf78287bc65f49d97ef9cc3ee", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "FALLOUT \u2013 WASTELAND WARFARE20\nSPECIAL EFFECT 1\nSPECIAL EFFECT 2\nCRITICAL METER\nELIMINATED WHEN READY\nIf a model that is Ready but not yet Used (see \np.13) is eliminated from play, take a Luck Token \nfrom the supply and flip it.

If a player rolls \ntwo Nuka Cola Bottles and uses one to activate \neffect A, they then no longer have enough to \nactivate effect B, yet could activate A again with \ntheir one remaining Nuka Cola Bottle.\n n While some Special Effects can be used \nmultiple times during the same attack, some \nare limited in the number of times they can \nbe used per attack. Such limits are shown by \na circled number after the icons required. If \nthere is no number, there is no limit. See below:\nSAMPLE SPECIAL EFFECT ACTIVATIONS\nICONS REQUIREMENTS AND LIMITS\nRequires 1 Blast icon. \nNo limit per attack.\nRequires Nuka Cola Bottle icons. \nNo limit per attack.\nRequires 1 Nuka Cola Bottle icon and \n1 Star icon.

Special Effects detailed outside the Critical \nMeter section of the card can be used with any \nattack, while those shown inside the Critical Meter \ncan only be used during a Critical Attack (see \n\u2018Critical Attacks\u2019, p.53).\nThe laser rifle (above) has two Special Effects:\n1. When fired, the model can use one Nuka Cola \nBottle icon (which are on the blue dice) for  \n1 damage to ignore armor, and\n2. The model can use two Nuka Cola Bottle results \nto set the target alight.\nAll attacks with this laser rifle can potentially use \nthe Special Effects.\nIf an effect says \u2018If target takes damage\u2019, the effect \nhappens if there is damage to be added after any \narmor roll.

Most \nArmor Ratings are shown as a single number, \nwhich is the maximum damage that it can block.\nTo check if \u2013 and how much \u2013 damage has been \nblocked, the red 12-sided Armor Dice is rolled, \nresulting in a number between 1 and 4.\n n If the number rolled is equal to or lower \nthan the relevant Armor Rating (e.g. matching \nphysical Armor Rating to physical damage), the \ndamage is reduced by the number rolled.\n n If the number rolled is greater than the Armor \nRating, no damage is blocked. \nFor example, a Brotherhood Knight with \nArmor Ratings of physical 2 / energy 2 is  \nhit by an attack doing 3 physical damage.  \nThe Knight rolls the Armor Dice and gets a 1,  \nso 1 point of damage is blocked and the Knight \ntakes 2 points of damage. If the armor roll had \nbeen 3 or 4, no damage would have been blocked \nand the Knight would take all 3 damage.\nA model\u2019s Armor Ratings are derived from one card \nwhich sets their values (often their own unit card) \nplus up to one card of each card type that modifies \nthose values. A model can set which cards it is using \nfor its Armor Ratings at the start of its activation.\nStrong Armor\nIf an Armor Rating shows two numbers separated \nby a \u2018+\u2019 (e.g. \u20183+1\u2019), the second number is a \u2018Strong \nArmor bonus\u2019. This is a fixed amount of damage \nthat the armor will always block, in addition to the \narmor roll indicated by the first number.\nExample: A Paladin wearing Power Armor \nwith a physical Armor Rating of 3+1 is hit \nby an attack dealing 3 physical damage. \nThe Paladin rolls a 2 so the armor blocks 2+1, \nmaking a total of 3 damage blocked. Had the \nroll been a 4, the armor would have blocked \n0+1 for a total of 1 damage blocked.\nARMOR BOOST TOKENS\nSome armor temporarily offers extra protection \u2013 \nwhether physical protection, energy dissipation, \nradiation resistance, etc. \u2013 which can wear down. \nArmor Boost Tokens are used to record and track \nthis \u2013 these tokens have an Armor Boost icon on \none side and two Armor Boost icons on the other.\nEach Armor Boost icon that a model possesses adds \none Strong Armor bonus (see above) to the Armor \nRating shown on a model\u2019s card. Each time a model \nwith Armor Boost icons is hit by an attack, one \nArmor Boost icon is discarded after the attack is \nresolved (regardless of whether damage is caused).\nExample: A Raider has an Armor Rating of  \n3 physical / 2 energy, and a token showing the \n+2 Armor Boost icon. Hit by an attack that \nwould cause energy damage, the Raider resolves \nthe armor as if it had a rating of 2+2, after \nwhich the Armor Boost Token is turned to the \nsingle-icon side.

As the Slide does not \nbreak engagement, it does not result in any free \nattacks. A Slide can move a model into engagement \nwith a model it was not already engaged with. \nThe Slide is part of a Close Combat attack so any \nTriggers (see p.42) based on the Close Combat occur \nafter the Slide has finished. \nWithdrawing from Being Engaged\nA model which is engaged with an enemy model  \ncan Move out of base-to-base contact (although it \nmay not Charge \u2013 see p.25). However, each model \nwith which they break engagement also gets an \nimmediate and free Quick Action attack on them, as \nlong as they are not engaged with any other models \nthemselves (such a Quick Action suffering the usual \n-2 Skill Value modifier; see p.40). \nThe free attacks are made after the player has \ncommitted to the model moving out of engagement \nand before the model executes its move.\nCLOSE COMBAT FOLLOWING A CHARGE\nIf a model making a Close Combat attack has a \nsingle Charge Bonus Marker next to it (see \n\u2018Charge Bonus\u2019, page 23) and the target is the \nmodel that was Charged to get the bonus, one \nblack or one green Effect Dice is added to the \nattack roll depending on the color of the Charge \nBonus Marker.

These are represented by \nInvestigation and Searchables Markers which \nare defined by the scenario.\nINVESTIGATION MARKERS\nInvestigation Markers represent items that need \nto be seen by a model from a distance to understand \nwhat they are. These may be obvious just by seeing \nthem (for example, Deathclaw tracks, a dropped \nbackpack containing medical samples, a wrecked \ncar, a breach in compound walls). Some may require \ncloser inspection (such as determining in which \ndirection tracks lead, or what\u2019s inside a backpack or \nfiling cabinet) \u2013 see \u2018Searchables\u2019, p.30.\nWhen added to the battlefield (often at the start of \na battle), Investigation Markers are placed face-\ndown on the battlefield. A player can look at any \nface-down Investigation Marker(s) which are both:\nA. wholly or partly within the Awareness range, \nand\nB. within Line of Sight of any of their models \n(regardless of the models\u2019 activation).\nExample: There are three Investigation \nMarkers near Aspirant Goddard, who has  \nBlue Awareness.

The charger receives one Black and one  \nGreen Charge Bonus Markers.\n3. After engaging the defender, the charger may \nperform a Push Back on them, up to a distance \nequal to the color of the charger\u2019s Battle Cry \nicon (see \u2018Push Back\u2019, below).\nIf the defender wins the Battle Cry Test, the \ncharger gains no benefits, plus the defender may \nimmediately use a Reaction to move their model \nout of engagement with the charger without giving \nthe charger a free attack (see \u2018Reactions\u2019, page 41).\nNote: Battle Cry is part of the Charge Action so \nany triggers are resolved after the Battle Cry is \nresolved (including any Push Back).\nBattle Cry Example:\nA Brute declares they are charging a Lancer, \nusing their Battle Cry skill. The Brute Charges \ninto base-to-base contact with the Lancer and \nchooses a black Charge Bonus Marker.

Both models have successful rolls but the \nBrute\u2019s result is highest so it is successful \nand it gain the benefits. (The Lancer has a \nReaction Marker, but cannot use it in response \nto the Charge due to the successful Battle Cry \n\u2013 see p.36).\nIf the Lancer had rolled a 3, they would have \nresisted, the Brute would have received no \nbonuses, and removed the Black Charge Bonus \nMarker too. Also, the Lancer could then have \nused their Reaction Marker in response to the \nCharge as normal to either attack the Brute \nor to move out of being engaged without it \nresulting in the usual free attack.\nPUSHER\nPUSHED \nMODEL", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3958, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c48a8a97-4aff-4b43-8244-f994db49d434": {"__data__": {"id_": "c48a8a97-4aff-4b43-8244-f994db49d434", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "742789de-5461-4ce4-b1e2-02e30344eebe", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "37", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "hash": "51b66398bc28c22d81ddfe114a39836150ab94cce91eb390c7f48c132b7584c4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "SECTION 4 \u2013 READY FOR ACTION 37\nUNIMPEDED ICON\nDOWNED BROTHERHOOD LANCERS TAKE COVER\nFOWW 2PB-002-111  \u2014 SECTION 4.2 \nTERRAIN\nPieces of terrain and scenery can be classified as \nNormal, Difficult, Impassable and/or Climbable \n(as well as whether they block Line of Sight and/or \ncount as cover \u2013 see page 17).\nNormal Terrain\nThere are no restrictions, bonuses or penalties for \nmovement across Normal Terrain.\nDifficult Terrain\nA model whose base will pass over any amount \nof Difficult Terrain during its movement uses one \ncolor range ruler shorter for their Movement than \ntheir usual Movement distance.

This \nlasts for that Reaction only and any further attacks \nwhilst engaged will incur the penalties for using a \nRanged Weapon in Close Combat as usual.\nNote that a Charge paired with a successful Battle \nCry does not provide a Trigger for a Reaction to a \nCharge, as the target of the Charge is considered \nmomentarily intimidated (see \u2018Battle Cry\u2019, p.36).\nLimits to Reactions\nA model can only have one Reaction Marker next \nto it at any time. In rare exceptions when a model \nis allowed to make multiple Reactions, a model can \nonly perform one Reaction for each Trigger they \nare aware of, i.e. a model can perform a Reaction \nto move after being aware of a valid Trigger, but \ncannot then immediately use another Reaction to \nshoot until aware of another Trigger.\nResetting Reaction Markers\nWhen a model is activated, its Reaction Marker is \ndiscarded.

Any part of \nthat Action can be a Trigger (even during the \nAction) but the Reaction is not assessed and \nresolved until the Triggering Action is complete. \nFor example, if a Triggering model moves out of \nthe reacting model\u2019s Line of Sight before they can \nreact, the reacting model may subsequently use \na Move Quick Action to re-establish LoS, but will \nbe unable to target the Triggering model with a \nShoot Quick Action.\nTRIGGERS\nTriggers are Actions that can prompt enemy \nmodels to make a Reaction (see above), if they are \naware of it. For example, a model close enough to \nsee an opposing model move or shoot can choose \nto use their Reaction Marker to perform a Quick \nAction to shoot at that model, pursue them, run \naway, etc.\nWhat Qualifies as a Trigger?\nExcept for Prepare, awareness of any Action \nby a model on the opposing side would count as a \nTrigger. A model being hit by an attack (whether \nit does damage or not) is also a Trigger.\nOccasionally, special events during a game may \nalso act as a Trigger \u2013 these will be described in \nthe scenario details.\nBeing Aware of a Trigger\nTo be aware of a Trigger, a model needs to have \nLine of Sight to the Trigger AND be close \nenough to the Action. The maximum distance \nwithin which a model is aware of a Trigger \ndepends on (a) the Action, and (b) the color of the \nAwareness icon on the lower left of the Prepared \nmodel\u2019s unit card.\nFor example, when measuring range for \nAwareness, a model in the unit shown below \nwould use the green range ruler indicated by \nthe icon in the bottom left of the card.\nAt up to one range ruler length away, a Trigger is \nany Action (except Prepare) or any allied model \n(including themselves) being hit by an attack.  \nThe only Triggers a model can be aware of at up  \nto two range ruler lengths away are movements \nand attacks. \nMultiple Perceptions of a Single Trigger\nWhen multiple models are aware of the same \nTrigger, the player that owns those models must \ndeclare (and commit to) any Reactions they wish \nto perform before resolving any of them, and then \nmust resolve all (and only) the ones declared in the \norder they wish.\nHELPFUL HINT\nfrom Vault Boy!\nIF IT\u2019S NOT PEOPLE SHOOTING AT YOU TO STEAL YOUR \nSTUFF, IT\u2019S PEOPLE WAITING TO SHOOT AT YOU AND \nSTEAL YOUR STUFF.

A unit with Power Armor places the Power \nArmor card underneath the unit card so that its \nundamaged (green) side protrudes to the right (see \nExample 1), with attribute lines aligned to show \nthe benefits. The Power Armor\u2019s Armor Ratings are \nshown at the bottom of the card. Items that increase \nArmor Ratings cannot be added to Power Armor.\nA model wearing Power Armor only gets one armor \nroll when hit, regardless of any armor worn beneath \nit. Before a model wearing Power Armor makes an \narmor roll, the player can choose to use the Armor \nRatings shown on the model\u2019s Power Armor card, \ninstead of the model\u2019s usual Armor Ratings.\nNote: The Armor Ratings of Power Armor cannot be \nincreased by equipment other than Power Armor \nmods. Also, Power Armor be only be repaired by items \nthat specifically state they affect Power Armor.\nDAMAGE TO POWER ARMOR\nWhen damage is applied to a model wearing \nundamaged Power Armor, Damage Tokens are \nplaced beside the Power Armor card until the total \nDamage Tokens equal the armor\u2019s End bonus. (Note \nthat it does not matter what attribute the model \nwearing the Power Armor uses for Health.)\nIn Example 1, the first 4 Damage Tokens will \nbe applied to the Power Armor card before any \nare placed on the model.\nWhen the total Damage Tokens on the armor card \nequal the armor\u2019s End bonus, the Power Armor is \ncategorized as degraded: its card is rotated from \nits green side to its yellow side to show the new \nbenefits. Any remaining damage is then applied. \nEven when degraded, Power Armor continues to give \nbenefits such as increased strength, negating falling \ndamage, and and other effects as shown on its card.\nIn Example 2, a Paladin with T-60 Power \nArmor has 3 Damage Tokens on their Power \nArmor card. With an End bonus of +4, the \nPower Armor is not yet degraded. Then the \nPaladin takes 2 more damage. The first \nDamage Token is added to the Power Armor \ncard which now has 4 Damage Tokens, \nequalling the End bonus: the Power Armor is \nnow degraded. The player rotates the card 180 \ndegrees to show its degraded side. It still gives \n+3 Str, but there is no more End bonus and the \nArmor Ratings are lower (although still better \nthan the Paladin\u2019s unit card). The second of the \n2 Damage Tokens is added to the unit card.\nFalling Damage and Power Armor\nPower Armor always negates ALL damage from \nfalling (including jumping).\nExample 1: A Paladin is wearing T-60 power \narmor that offers +3 Str and +4 End bonuses. \nThe model has a total of Str 9 and End 9. \nHowever, the Armor Ratings do not stack.\nA FOURTH DAMAGE \nTOKEN EQUALS THE \nENDURANCE BONUS OF \nTHE GREEN SIDE OF THE \nPOWER ARMOR CARD.  \nIT IS NOW ROTATED TO \nTHE YELLOW SIDE.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3014, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5d55c407-75b2-470f-bcdd-af46a1d55dc5": {"__data__": {"id_": "5d55c407-75b2-470f-bcdd-af46a1d55dc5", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6b3c51da-d257-4c05-9bc5-fa21df11e6c8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "hash": "93aee681dd9988489f9a50d0dd1a1d189b0bbf8574e0e094e229d4d7900d3cd6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "FALLOUT \u2013 WASTELAND WARFARE46\nFOWW 2PB-002-111  \u2014 SECTION 5.3\nADVANCED WEAPONS\nMINES\nAn unengaged model can use a Move Action to place \na mine up to Orange from the model.

These \nPrimed Weapons can only be used once they have \nacquired a requisite number of tokens (e.g. a \u2018Primed \n3\u2019 weapon requires 3 tokens before it can be used). \nUse Counting Tokens to track this, placing them \nnext to the model whose weapon is being primed.\nThe circumstances in which these weapons \ngain tokens \u2013 as well as the procedure for their \nactivation \u2013 are detailed on the weapon or relevant \nunit card. Note that while their activation may be \ndetailed in the Critical Meter area of a weapon card, \nPrimed Weapon attacks are not Critical Attacks.\nWALKED FIRE\nWeapons with the Walked Fire ability fire multiple \nshots each time a Shoot Action is used to fire them.  \nEach shot is resolved with a separate Skill Test. \nAfter a shot is resolved, the target of the next shot \ncan be the same target or any viable target within \nthe color shown on the weapon card (remember that \na target can also be a point on the battlefield). Cover \nand LoS are calculated for each shot as usual.\nWalked Fire weapons can gain a maximum of 1 \nCritical Point during each Shoot Action, and can  \ngain a maximum of 1 AP during each Shoot Action \n(excluding Quick Actions). \nA shot that hits a target gains one additional \nArmor Reduction icon for each successive hit by \nthe weapon on the same target (during the same \nAction). This effect is cumulative. Therefore, this \neffect resets if a shot misses or changes target.\nAll shots fired are Triggers but all Reactions take \nplace after the entire Shoot Action or Quick Action \nis completed (as usual) and a model can only \nrespond to one of the Triggers.\nSCATTER\nWhen a Shoot or Throw Action Skill Test fails while \nusing a weapon whose card shows the Scatter icon, \nits Skill Dice result will determine if it deviates from \nthe intended target to a new location.\nWhen the effect of a weapon needs scatter \ncalculated, two factors are applied to the intended \ntarget location before resolving damage:\n1. the distance from the intended target, and\n2. the direction from the intended target.\nScatter Distance\nThe distance of the scatter is based on the amount \nby which the modified Skill Dice result failed. \nThe weapon card shows the distance of the scatter \nbased on this margin (see below).\nFor example, if an attack with the Missile \nLauncher failed by a margin of 3 or 4, it would \nscatter Yellow distance.\nIf an X is rolled, the scatter distance used is the \nlargest scatter distance shown on the weapon card.\nScatter Direction\nThe direction in which the scatter goes is random. \nTo determine the direction, take the Scatter Token \n(the same token as the Advantage Marker) and \nphysically flip it onto the battlefield \u2013 the direction \nof the scatter is shown by the arrow. Alternatively, \nuse a directional spinner, dice or other randomizer.\nScatter Collisions with Obstacles\nIf it does not have a Grenade icon, check a straight \nline from the firer to the new target location. If this \nline passes through an obstacle, the effect is resolved \nwhere the line contacts the obstacle.\nMULTIPLE EFFECTS\nIf a weapon shows multiple effects, these are \naccumulated and the combined effect resolved. For \nexample, the Missile Launcher causes 2 damage to \nall models in a yellow area but also an additional \ndamage to the target; therefore, the target would \nresolve 3 damage plus any icons from effect dice.\nSCATTER ICON\nSCATTER TOKEN/ \nADVANTAGE \nMARKER\nGRENADE ICON\nWALKED FIRE \nICON\nCOUNTING \nTOKENS\nTHE WALKED FIRE ICON \nABOVE SHOWS THAT THE \nWEAPON FIRES 5 TIMES, \nWITH A MAXIMUM \nDISTANCE BETWEEN \nTARGETS OF YELLOW.\nWHEN THE TARGET \nICON IS SHOWN ON A \nWEAPON CARD, THE \nEFFECT APPLIES TO ONLY \nONE TARGET.\nTARGET ICON", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3749, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ab91a361-538e-4a75-a2a7-0542138b5345": {"__data__": {"id_": "ab91a361-538e-4a75-a2a7-0542138b5345", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f6113692-8adf-4818-b606-ff0fb568e706", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "48", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "hash": "356677f177b37920ddc7efc91c9de177c80f78b36e592ef68777e07160652935", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "FALLOUT \u2013 WASTELAND WARFARE48\nFOWW 2PB-002-111  \u2014 SECTION 5.4 \nCONDITIONS\nA model can be subject to one or more conditions, \nusually as a result of weapon effects.

A model which is On Fire can \nperform Actions as normal. However, if a model is \nOn Fire at the start of its activation:\n1. Add 1 regular damage to the model (no armor \nroll), then\n2. Flip a Luck Token from the supply. If it  \nlands Luck side up, the fire goes out \u2013  \nremove the On Fire Marker; otherwise, the \ncondition remains.\nA model which is On Fire can use a Move Action \n(or Quick Action, if able) to attempt to put the \nfire out. Attempting this requires an Agi Test: if \nsuccessful, the fire goes out and the On Fire Marker \nis removed. Note: the model cannot move anywhere \nduring this Action, but such a Move Action is a \nTrigger, and can be a Reaction to a Trigger (see \npp.41-42).  A Frozen condition (see above) replaces \nany existing On Fire condition.\nPOISONED\nWhen a model is Poisoned, place a Poisoned \nMarker next to it as a reminder. If a model is \nPoisoned at the start of its activation, add 1 regular \ndamage to the model (no armor roll). A model  \nwhich is Poisoned can perform Actions as normal.  \nA model which is Poisoned can use an item that \ncures poison to remove the condition. Robots, and \nsome creatures, are immune to poison.\nSLOW\nModels can become slow due to various conditions, \nsuch as an injured leg.. When a model gains the \nslow condition, place a Slow Marker next to it. \nWhen slow, all of a model\u2019s Movements are at one \ncolor shorter. This effect occurs before any other \nmovement distance changes are applied such as \nwhen using a Quick Action for Move or Charge or \nwhen moving over Difficult Terrain. A movement \ncannot be shorter than Orange.\nSTUNNED\nWhen a model is Stunned, place a Stunned \nMarker next to it. A model with the Stunned \ncondition can perform no Action other than to use a \nMove Action (or Quick Action, if able) to remove the \nStunned Marker. Note that the the model spends \nthis Action to shake off the condition, and cannot \nactually move anywhere during such an Action. \nHowever, such a Move Action is a trigger, and can \nbe a Reaction to a trigger.\nStunned models do not block movement of opposing \nmodels, but models may not finish their movement if \ntheir base overlaps the base of the Stunned model.\nSee also \u2018Stunned while Engaged\u2019, page 25.\nFROZEN \nMARKER\n-2 MARKER\nSLOW \nMARKER\nON FIRE \nMARKER\nPOISONED \nMARKER\nSLOW \nMARKER\nSTUNNED \nMARKER\nINJURE \nARM ICON\nINJURED \nLEG ICON\nFROZEN \nICON\nFIRE ICON\nPOISON \nICON\nSLOW \nICON\nSTUN \nICON\nSTOP!\nNow\u2019s a great \ntime to try out\nTUTORIAL 4\nIN THE CAMPAIGN HANDBOOK", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3656, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "17edab00-de4a-477e-9a6d-696a2f3e2271": {"__data__": {"id_": "17edab00-de4a-477e-9a6d-696a2f3e2271", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "817a48ad-fcbe-4aae-83b7-d75dead24a63", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "49", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "hash": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 0, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "3847485c-c3bb-4dfb-b5a1-bf5fe0c10511": {"__data__": {"id_": "3847485c-c3bb-4dfb-b5a1-bf5fe0c10511", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "870ad991-f17f-4148-90a3-8abff7580488", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "50", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "hash": "a08a4d05ec9f1517d7b984540db1900f654fdd2087c4c2069b1f8676dfaf157c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "FALLOUT \u2013 WASTELAND WARFARE50\nFOWW 2PB-002-111  \u2014 SECTION 6.1\nADVANCED UNITS AND MODELS\nLEADERS\nAURA ABILITY \nICON\nTHE SOLE SURVVOR \nIS MADE A LEADER BY \nPLACING A LEADER CARD \nABOVE THE UNIT CARD.\nTHIS IS THE RANGE UP \nTO WHICH ANY AURA \nABILITIES HAVE EFFECT.\nLEADER CARD \nICON\nHEROIC CARD \nICON\nLUCK\nA HEROIC MODEL  \nCAN USE LUCK  \n(SEE LUCK, P .52).\nACTION POINT USE\nA HEROIC MODEL CAN SPEND \nACTION POINTS TO PERFORM \nTHESE QUICK ACTIONS IN \nADDITION TO THEIR USUAL \nTWO ACTIONS PER ROUND  \n(SEE \u2018ACTION POINTS\u2019, P .40).\nV.A.T.S.\nGENERATES ACTION \nPOINTS WHEN A HEROIC \nMODEL IS USED (SEE \n\u2018ACTION POINTS\u2019, P .40).\nHEALTH\nTHE HEALTH VALUE OF \nA HEROIC MODEL IS \nINCREASED BY 1.\nCRITICALS\nA HEROIC MODEL CAN \nGAIN AND USE CRITICAL \nPOINTS TO USE THE \nPOWERFUL, CRITICAL \nEFFECT OF WEAPONS  \n(SEE \u2018CRITICALS\u2019, P .53).\nEach side in a battle has one single-model unit \nwhich acts as its Leader.

A neutral unit \n(a unit without a specific faction) such as the robot \nMr Handy counts as the Leader\u2019s faction.\nA player\u2019s faction is determined by their Leader\u2019s \nfaction.\nTYPES\nSome models might belong to a unit type with \nspecific rules (see table, right). Each type has an \nicon to identify it. Types are separate to factions.\nDOG AND DOG HANDLER\nDogs\nDogs count as the same faction as the player\u2019s \nLeader.\nDog Handler\nDog Handler is an aura ability (see \u2018Leader\u2019, p.50) \nthat some units possess. Any Dog that starts their \nactivation within the aura of a model (of the same \nfaction) with the Dog Handler ability has two \nbenefits during their activation:\n1. The Dog model may use the Search skill, based \non its own PEr.\n2. If the Dog Handler model is Heroic (see \nprevious page) then the dog model is Heroic too.\nNote that these benefits only last for the Dog \nmodel\u2019s activation, and do not affect the Dog\u2019s \nReaction, if it has one; it is not necessary to track \nwhether a Dog was Heroic during its activation.\nAt the start of a battle, place Luck Tokens (see \nfollowing page) on the Dog Unit card equal to the \nunit\u2019s LuC. These tokens can only be used when a \nDog is Heroic, and the pool it starts with does not \nincrease even if further Dogs in the unit (or the \nsame Dog) become Heroic later in the battle.\nWhen a Dog is Heroic, Critical Points (see page 53) \nare added to relevant weapon cards as usual, but \nthe Critical Effect of a fully-charged weapon can \nonly be used by a Dog while it is Heroic.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4085, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7e107098-c2f1-4a5b-82ff-eaf5dbe09875": {"__data__": {"id_": "7e107098-c2f1-4a5b-82ff-eaf5dbe09875", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2271b313-9535-4fc9-87dd-514a19ab9a49", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "52", "file_name": "Fallout  Wasteland Warfare Rulebook.pdf"}, "hash": "b1ce69bc84e0be614ddd1c84c0206d471145194e53f5307582f8aabfb1f5dbf4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "FALLOUT \u2013 WASTELAND WARFARE\n52\nLUCK ICON\nTWO SIDES OF THE \nLUCK TOKEN\nFOWW 2PB-002-111  \u2014 SECTION 6.2 \nL UCK\nDuring game set-up, units that can use Luck \nreceive Luck Tokens equal to their LuC stat and \nthese are placed beside the relevant unit\u2019s card. \nPrimarily, the Luck icon is found on Heroic cards, \nbut may also be found on some unit or ability \ncards. A unit with multiple Luck icons gets no \nextra benefit. \nLuck allows units with a Luck icon on any of their \ncards to improve their fate. Luck Tokens can be \nused for several different effects depending upon \nthe situation, including Accurate to shift a near-\nmiss to success, Dodge to avoid a hit, Tough to \nreduce damage, and Extra Critical for bonus CPs. \nWhile Luck Tokens do not grant re-rolls, they can \nshift a borderline result in your favor! \nWhen a Luck Token is used, it is taken from \nthe unit\u2019s card and flipped onto the battlefield, \nresulting in either the blank side (a failure) or \nLuck icon facing up (a success). A player using a \nLuck Token must declare what it is being used \nfor before flipping it. Once used, a Luck Token is \ndiscarded. A model may never have more Luck \nTokens than its LuC.\nUsing Multiple Luck Tokens\nA unit may use multiple Luck Tokens but may \nnot use more than one to attempt to modify the \nsame result. For example, one Luck Token can be \nused to Dodge against an attacking Skill Test, \nand if that fails, the same unit can spend a second \nLuck Token to try to Tough it out and modify the \ndamage sustained. But they may not use two Luck \nTokens against the same Skill Test result or damage \ncalculation. \nACCURATE: LUCK WHEN ROLLING A SKILL ROLL\nAfter an unsuccessful Skill Test has been rolled for \na model, its player declares if they are going to use \na Luck Token. Only one Luck Token can be used on \nany one test. If the result is a Luck icon, the Skill \nDice result receives a -2 modifier, perhaps changing \na narrow failure to a success. Note that Luck cannot \nbe used if the original test was already successful \u2013 \ni.e. Luck cannot make a test even more successful. \nAlso, the X result on the Skill Dice is not a number \nso cannot be altered by Luck.\nDODGE: LUCK WHEN HIT BY AN ATTACK\nAfter a successful attack has been rolled (and even \nif Luck was used to make it succeed), yet before \ndamage is calculated, the player whose model was \nattacked can declare if the target model will use \na Luck Token. Success means the attacker\u2019s roll \nreceives a +2 modifier. As a result, Luck can make \na successful attack miss. Criticals automatically set \nthe Skill Dice to 1 and Luck cannot change this.\nNote that Luck cannot be used by the attacker after \na target has successfully used Luck to make an \nattack miss, even if Luck was not already used by \nthe attacker.\nTOUGH: LUCK WHEN TAKING DAMAGE\nA Luck Token can be flipped by a model which is \nabout to have damage applied due to any cause \u2013 \nthis is done after the damage is fully calculated, \nafter armor, but before being applied. If a Luck icon \nis revealed, the damage is reduced by 1.\nEXTRA CRITICAL: LUCK TO GENERATE CRITICAL POINTS WHEN ATTACKING\nA Luck Token can be flipped by a model which has \njust made a successful attack (after factoring in \nany Luck used by the attacker and/or target).

A \nplayer can also choose not to use the Critical Effect, \nleaving the Critical Meter fully-charged until \nthe Critical Effect is used. Note: a weapon which \nbecomes fully-charged because of CPs gained from \nan attack roll cannot use its Critical Effect during \nthat current attack. \nA player declares a Critical Attack using a \nweapon which has a fully-charged Critical Meter \nand rolls the relevant Effect Dice shown on the \ncard. However, the Skill Dice is not rolled and is \nconsidered to be an automatic success regardless of \nother effects or modifiers.

The gray-and-white flip side of the marker \nshows when the model is Used so it cannot be activated \nagain during the current round. \nSlow Firing \nSome weapons can only be fired once per round. The \nLoaded side (gold) of this token shows the weapon can \nbe fired. When fired, flip the token to Empty (gray) and \ncan not be fired until turned back to loaded.\nFire \nA Fire Token indicates a model is On Fire, and is flipped \nto see if a fire goes out or continues.\nPoison \nA Poisoned model takes damage each round.\nStunned \nA Stunned model must use an Action to shake off their  \nStunned condition before taking any other actions.\nSlow \nA Slow model\u2019s Movements are at one distance shorter \nthan normal.\nFrozen \nFrozen lasts until end of model\u2019s activation.\nLock \nPlaced on the battlefield to show a locked object.\nComputer \nPlaced on the battlefield to show a computer terminal.  \nAI \nPlaced on the battlefield during solo or co-operative \ngames to identify the AI models. See the Campaign \nHandbook, p.8. The dust cloud marker is not \nused in the two-player set but will be utilized \nby additional rules to be released later.\nInvestigation Marker\nPlaced on the battlefield, Investigation Markers \nrepresent items that need to be seen by a model from a \ndistance to understand what they are. They are usually \nscenario objectives. Investigation Markers within \nAwareness range of a model can be viewed, and the \nflip side of an Investigation Marker features either a \nBlank, Number or Toolbox \n(Searchable) icon. See \n\u2018Investigation Markers\u2019, p.29. \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \nSearchables\nPlaced on the battlefield, these markers represent items \nthat need close examination to know what they are, for \nexample, a filing cabinet, a locked suitcase, a booby-\ntrapped desk.

As the players take turns, they use their cards to build \ntheir civilizations from single cities to sprawling empires \nfilled with wonders and technology.\nThe player who has the event dial is the first player; he or she \ntakes the first turn of the game. Players continue to take turns \nin clockwise order until the game ends. A player wins the \ngame by completing one agenda on each victory card. The full \nrules for winning the game are described on page 12.\nAdditionally, world events occur periodically that affect the \nmap and all of the players, such as barbarian attacks. Before \neach of the first player\u2019s turns (excluding the first turn), the \nfirst player advances the event dial, possibly producing one \nof these events. The event dial and its effects are described \nlater on page 12.\nTHE FOCUS ROW\nA player\u2019s turn revolves around the concept of the focus row, \nwhich is the row of five cards below his or her focus bar. The \nfocus row represents a nation\u2019s various pursuits, such as \nscientific advancements, cultural developments, and military \nproduction. Each focus row has five slots, one for each card.\nThe cards in a player\u2019s focus row shift to different slots as the \nplayer takes turns. A card generally shifts toward the fifth slot \nuntil it is used, which is when it moves back to the first slot. \nFrom there, it will slowly shift toward the fifth slot again.\nThis process represents the investment of time; a card \nresolved in the fifth slot has a greater impact than a \ncard resolved in the first slot. A key strategy in the game \nis knowing when to resolve a card in a low slot for its \nimmediate effect and when to wait to resolve a card for its \nmaximum effect.\nFirst Slot Fifth Slot\n+1 Production for Wonders\nPottery\nIndustry\nI\nBuild 1 world wonder.

Spaces on the map have \na terrain represented by art. The five basic types of terrain \neach correspond to a slot on the focus bar: grassland (1), hills \n(2), forest (3), desert (4), and mountains (5). A terrain\u2019s slot \nnumber is its difficulty. \nTerrain affects many aspects of the game. In general, terrain \nthat corresponds to a higher slot is more difficult to expand \ninto and more difficult to conquer.\nThe sixth terrain type, water, does not appear on the focus \nbar. Water has a difficulty of one, but players generally \ncannot interact with water unless a card specifically allows \nthem to do so.\nWhen a space appears to have more than one terrain, its \nterrain is the type that covers the most area in the space.\nFRIENDLY AND RIVAL\nMany cards refer to spaces or game pieces as friendly or \nrival. All of the control tokens and plastic figures of a player\u2019s \ncolor are friendly to that player. All of the control tokens and \nplastic figures of other colors are rival to that player. Similarly, \nthe spaces that contain a player\u2019s cities or control tokens are \nfriendly to that player, and spaces that contain cities and \ncontrol tokens of other colors are rival to that player.\nCaravans do not cause a space to be friendly or rival.\nGrassland (1)\n Hills (2)\n Forest (3)\nDesert (4) Mountain (5)\n Water (1)\nEMPTY SPACES\nA space is empty if it does not contain any tokens or plastic \nfigures of any kind.\nRESOURCES AND NATURAL WONDERS\nResources and natural wonders power the creation of \namazing world wonders. There are four types of resources: \nPlayers can collect these tokens from the map and spend \nthem when building world wonders. When a player spends a \nresource token, it is returned it to the supply. \nA natural wonder token can be spent as a \nresource of the type shown on the token. \nHowever, when a natural wonder token is \nspent, it is not returned to the supply. The \nnatural wonder token can be spent again \nduring future turns, but it cannot be spent \nmore than once per turn.\nSpaces with natural wonder tokens do not have a terrain \ntype, but the terrain difficulty of all natural wonder spaces  \nis five.\nCITIES AND MATURE CITIES\nCities are the focal points around which empires are built. \nThey allow players to extend into new areas of the map.\nMature cities are fully developed cities that contribute to \nthe well-being of a player\u2019s civilization. They periodically \ngenerate trade tokens (which are described later) and act as \nnew starting points for caravans.\nA city is mature when each space adjacent to it either \ncontains a friendly control token or is a water space. Cities on \nthe edge of the map can mature faster because they have \nfewer adjacent spaces.\nMarble\n Mercury\n Oil\n Diamond\n\u201cCrater Lake\u201d \nNatural Wonder\nBecause the orange player\u2019s city is on the edge of the map, it \nonly has four adjacent spaces.

A focus card\u2019s type is \nindicated by an icon in the upper-left corner. Each player\u2019s \nfocus row contains one card of each type.\nDuring the game, players acquire advanced versions of their \nstarting focus cards, which have a greater impact on the \ngame. An advanced card is resolved using the same rules as \nthe starting card of that type, but it may have an additional \neffect (e.g., allowing caravans to cross water).\nThe following sections describe the rules for each type of \nfocus card.\nCULTURE\nCulture focus cards allow players to place control tokens, \nwhich expands territory and claims resources. The card\u2019s \nfocus row slot determines which types of terrain the player \ncan place control tokens on.\nTo place a control token, the player takes one of his or her \nunused control tokens and places it on a space adjacent to \na friendly city. If that space contains a resource or natural \nwonder token, he or she places that resource or natural \nwonder token next to his or her leader sheet. \nThe player must obey the following rules:\n \u2666 The player cannot place the token on a water space or on \nany space whose terrain corresponds to a higher focus row \nslot than the culture card\u2019s slot. All natural wonders are \ntreated as having a terrain difficulty of five.\n \u2666 The space cannot contain a barbarian token, city, city-state, \nor control token.\n \u2666 The token must be placed on its unreinforced side (the side \nthat does not have a white circle around the icon).\n+1 Tech Dial Advancement\nReplaceable P arts\nScience\nIII\nGain 1 resource of your choice from the \nsupply. Y ou cannot gain a resource of a \ntype that you already have.\nThen, advance your tech dial a number of \nspaces equal to this slot\u2019s number.\nFocus Card  \nIcon and Type\nUnreinforced Side \nof Control Token\nIf the red player resolves her culture card in the first or second \nslot, she can place her control tokens on grassland and hills.\nSCIENCE\nThe science focus card advances a player\u2019s tech dial, allowing \nthe player to discover new technologies. The card\u2019s focus row \nslot determines how much the dial advances.\nTo advance a tech dial, the player rotates the dial\u2019s pointer \nclockwise a number of spaces (dots and numbers) equal to \nthe number of the science card\u2019s focus row slot. \nEach focus card has a tech level, and some spaces on the tech \ndial are paired with a tech level:\nWhen the dial\u2019s pointer advances to (or passes) a tech level \nspace, the player may gain a new focus card. He or she can \nchoose any card from his or her focus card deck whose tech \nlevel exactly matches the tech level reached on the dial. The \nchosen card replaces the card of the same type in his or her \nfocus row; the replaced card is returned to the deck.\nECONOMY\nEconomy focus cards allow a player to interact with city-states \nand rival cities by moving caravans. The card\u2019s focus row slot \ndetermines which terrain types the caravans can move into.\nEach player starts the game with one caravan on his or her \neconomy card. During the game, a player may gain better \neconomy cards that increase the number of caravans he or she \ncan use.

The number \nof trade tokens that player places is equal to the \nnumber of mature cities he or she controls.\nWINNING THE GAME\nEach victory card is divided into two agendas; the players\u2019 \nobjective is to complete one agenda on each victory card \nnext to the map. The meaning of each agenda\u2019s icon is \ndescribed on the back page of the rulebook.\nWhen a player completes an agenda, that player places one \nof his or her control tokens next to that agenda\u2019s victory \ncard. Even if the player ceases to satisfy the agenda later, the \ntoken remains and the player does not need to complete an \nagenda on that card again. \nAt the start of the first player\u2019s turn, if a player has completed \none agenda on each victory card, that player wins. If there is \na tie, the tied player with the most world wonders wins. If still \ntied, the tied player with the most friendly spaces wins.\nADDITIONAL RULES\nThis section provides players with the additional rules \nneeded to play the game.\nTHE EVENT DIAL\nThe event dial governs effects that are not part of any player\u2019s \nturn, such as barbarian activity. Before the first player starts \neach of his or her turns (excluding the first turn), he or she \nmust rotate the event dial\u2019s pointer clockwise to the next \nsection. If that section has an icon, the first player resolves \nthe effect of that icon. Then, the first player starts his or her \nturn. Each icon on the event dial is described below.\nBarbarian Movement\nBarbarians rove around the map, seeking \ncaravans to plunder and cities to raze. When the \npointer rotates to this icon, each barbarian on \nthe map moves. To determine the direction they \nall move, the first player rolls a die and matches \nthe result to a direction on the barbarian direction token. \nEach barbarian token moves one space in the rolled direction.\nIf a barbarian moves into a space that contains a player\u2019s \ncomponent, that player resolves the corresponding effect:\n \u2666 Caravan: The component is destroyed and returned to its \nplayer\u2019s economy focus card.\n \u2666 Unreinforced Control Token or Non-Capital City:  \nThe component is destroyed and returned to its player.\n \u2666 Reinforced Control Token: The token is flipped to its \nunreinforced side and the barbarian returns to the space it \nmoved from.\n \u2666 Capital City: The player chooses and discards a total of two \ntrade tokens from the cards in his or her focus row.\nIf a barbarian moves into a water space, it continues to move \nin the rolled direction until it reaches a non-water space. If a \nbarbarian would move off the edge of the map, it moves in \nthe opposite direction instead.\n12\nThe first player rolls a \u201c2\u201d for barbarian movement. \nEach barbarian moves in the direction marked \u201c2\u201d on \nthe barbarian direction token.\n1. Barbarian \u201cD\u201d moves into a space containing a \nplayer\u2019s city, destroying that city.\n2. Barbarian \u201cF\u201d moves into a water space. Because it \ncannot stop in a water space, it continues moving \nin the rolled direction.\nMoving a Barbarian\n2\n1", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3722, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "5b7c14a2-a0b0-4d70-9852-d975acde653d": {"__data__": {"id_": "5b7c14a2-a0b0-4d70-9852-d975acde653d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "Sid Meier's Civilization  A New Dawn Rulebook.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "cbe0e8ef-8a3a-4943-a57c-fb115dee2d8a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "13", "file_name": "Sid Meier's Civilization  A New Dawn Rulebook.pdf"}, "hash": "46d37e9eeabf4d56f9ea258eca195034030b957398549c73f201bff36a7a00f4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "city-state or player.CITY-STATES\nA city-state is a small, sovereign state that \nis neutral toward all players.

Each player \ntakes charge of a different civilization and attempts to lead their \npeople to greatness.\nStarting with a civilization composed of a single, humble \ncity lacking even the most rudimentary of inventions, each \nplayer tries to advance their people by building new cities and \nimproving them, researching new technologies, increasing their \ncivilization\u2019s culture, and harvesting valuable resources.\nAs the players create new cities and explore the world around \nthem, they come into contact with smaller civilizations, \nsome peaceful, some warlike. Players can absorb these minor \ncivilizations into their own, garnering rewards for doing so.\nUltimately, however, the players\u2019 most difficult challenge is \nfacing each other, as one ascendant civilization collides with \nanother. Players may wage war on the battlefield, broker sly \ndeals in the shadows, or race to be the first to build the majestic \nwonders in order to become the dominant civilization on Earth. \nTh e Ob j e cT Of Th e Ga m e\n\u201cLet us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let \nus, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.\u201d\n \u2013Abraham Lincoln\nEach player can win Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization: The Board Game \nin one of four ways.\nA c u l t u r e v i c t o r y is achieved by devoting cities to the arts and \nspending the culture points gained as a result to advance up the \nculture track to its end. The culture track is described in more \ndetail on pages 17\u201318.\nA t e c h v i c t o r y is accomplished by researching the Space Flight \ntech. Doing so requires the player to build up their tech pyramid \nhigh enough to allow them to research a level 5 tech. The tech \npyramid is described in more detail on pages 11 and 21\u201322.\nAn e c o n o m i c v i c t o r y is completed by accumulating 15 coins. \nCoins are a measure of economic power, and gaining them \nmakes a civilization more efficient. Coins and the means to \nacquire them are described in more detail on page 26.\nFinally, a m i l i t a r y v i c t o r y is achieved by conquering one other \nplayer\u2019s capital.

G. Wells\nBefore playing Sid Meier\u2019s Civilization: The Board Game for \nthe first time, carefully punch out the cardboard components, \nmaking sure to keep them away from small children and \nanimals.\nThen, take the civilization sheets, trade dials, economy dials, and \nplastic connectors and assemble them as shown below.\nFor the first game, it is recommended that new players play a \nsimplified learning game. Simply return Egypt , Rome, and the \nwonders (both cards and markers) to the box, and then ignore \nthe rules for wonders for that game. Otherwise, play as normal \nuntil a player builds their third city. At that point, end the game \nand (if time allows and the players so desire) start a new game \nafter adding Egypt, Rome, and the wonders back in. The point of \nthe learning game is to familiarize the players with the various \nelements of the game, so there are no winners or losers in it.\nGe n e r a l seTu p\nThis section explains the general setup of the game.\n1. chO Os e ci v i l i z aTiOn s a nD cOlOr s\nEach player draws a civilization sheet at random and places it \nfaceup in front of them. Optionally, players may select their \ncivilizations if all players agree. Return any unused civilization \nsheets to the box. Each player then chooses a player color.\n2. Di sTr i b uTe pl a y e r cOm pOn e nTs\nEach player takes the following in their player color:\nEight plastic figures (6 armies and 2 scouts)\u2022 \nThree city markers (1 capital and 2 cities)\u2022 \nFour military tech markers\u2022 \nOne deck of 36 tech cards\u2022 \nPlayers also receive:\nOne reference sheet \u2022 \nOne setup card\u2022 \nOne deck of government cards (4 cards)\u2022 \n3. seT up ma r k eT bOa rD\nPlace the market board at one end of the table, as shown in the \ndiagram on page 9. On it, place the following:\na. un iT ca rDs\nSort the unit cards by type \u2013 artillery, infantry, mounted, and \naircraft. Then, shuffle each deck, and place it on the marked space. \nFinally, give each player one artillery, one infantry, and one \nmounted unit. These units are placed facedown in a single pile \nnear the player and are known as the player\u2019s s t a n d i n g Fo r c e s.\nb. mi l iTa r y Te c h ma r k e r s\nEach player takes their lower ranked (one stripe on one side, two \nstripes on the other) military tech markers for artillery, infantry, \nand mounted units and places them in the area below the \nappropriate unit deck so that the sides with one stripe are faceup. \nThey each then take their aircraft military marker and place \nit below the aircraft unit deck so that the side with the star is \nfacedown. The other military tech markers are set aside for now.\nc. bu i lDi nG ma r k e r s\nSort the building markers by type and place them on their \nindicated spaces. Note that a building with an arrow next to its \nname is an upgraded building and is found on the back of the \nun-upgraded building tile.\nD. wOnDe r ca rDs (nO T u s eD i n Th e l e a r n i nG Ga m e)\nBuild the wonder deck by shuffling the ancient, medieval, and \nmodern wonders separately. Place the modern wonders facedown \non the top space of the wonder market. Then place the medieval \nwonders (also facedown) on top of them. Finally, place the ancient \nwonders faceup in the four market spaces below the wonder deck.\nException: If Egypt is playing, Egypt receives one of the ancient \nwonders at random before the remainder are placed in the \nmarket. One of the medieval wonders is then drawn and placed \nin the market to replace the missing ancient wonder.\n8\nMany of the abilities and cards in this \ngame allow the players to break the rules \nin a variety of ways. In the event that an \nability or card conflicts with these rules, \nthe ability or card takes priority.\nTh e GOlDe n ru l e", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3862, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "744dca0b-b00c-471c-aa07-ffd00dff7bca": {"__data__": {"id_": "744dca0b-b00c-471c-aa07-ffd00dff7bca", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Sid Meier's Civilization  The Board Game Rulebook.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "905f3e33-3fce-4f85-89ba-d411efd88093", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "9", "file_name": "Sid Meier's Civilization  The Board Game Rulebook.pdf"}, "hash": "19773a61ba526e3974eeabbacbf1ff9be72bf5e1c6666b6730174a707b7baa7a", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "seTu p Di aGr a m\n(Numbers refer to General Setup steps.)\nma p seTu p b y nu m b e r Of pl a y e r s\n(Arrows indicate tile orientation.)\n9\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3A\n3B\n3C\n3D\n 3E\n3F\n 3F\n3G\n7\n6\n4\n5\n 9\n8\nFo u r pl a y e r sth r e e pl a y e r stWo pl a y e r s", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 250, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9b118b50-1e66-469f-8677-144e57e6da32": {"__data__": {"id_": "9b118b50-1e66-469f-8677-144e57e6da32", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Sid Meier's Civilization  The Board Game Rulebook.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8846dfc1-61b5-43e0-b04a-9909c4d4193d", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "10", "file_name": "Sid Meier's Civilization  The Board Game Rulebook.pdf"}, "hash": "dc71c1653cd704d4a998c2e3f512c6e751dd5de016e74dbbbf73401f365b4490", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "e. wOnDe r ma r k e r s (nO T u s eD i n Th e l e a r n i nG Ga m e)\nLook at the four faceup wonder cards in the market spaces below \nthe wonder deck, find the matching wonder marker for each, and \nplace the marker in the space next to its wonder card.\nf. cu lTu r e ev e nT ca rDs\nSeparate the culture event cards into ancient (one column), \nmedieval (two columns), and modern (three columns) decks. \nShuffle each deck separately and place it facedown on its indicated \nspace below the culture track at the bottom of the market board.\nG. cu lTu r e le v e l ma r k e r s\nEach player takes the culture level marker showing their leader \nand places it on the start space of the culture track.\n4. seT up ma r k eT re sOu r c e s\nPlace one of each market resource token per player near the market \nboard, returning any extras to the box.

These phases are performed in \nthe order listed below. During each phase, starting with the first \nplayer and continuing clockwise around the table, every player \nhas the opportunity to perform the actions associated with that \nphase. The phases of a turn are as follows:\nStart of Turn1. \nTrade2. \nCity Management3. \nMovement4. \nResearch5. \n1. sTa rT Of Tu r n\nDuring this phase, the first player marker is passed one player \nto the left (except on the first turn). Then, the new first player \nperforms any start of turn actions (usually found on wonders \nor culture event cards), builds any new cities (see page 13), and \nchanges governments if desired (see page 14). After the first \nplayer completes their Start of Turn Phase, the player to the \nfirst player\u2019s left begins their Start of Turn Phase. This process \ncontinues until all players have completed their Start of Turn \nPhase.\n2. Tr aDe\nDuring this phase, each player collects trade from all of their \ncities, and then the players may negotiate with each other, \ntrading a variety of game resources up to and including \npromises (see pages 14\u201315). This phase may be simultaneously \nperformed by every player to save time.\n3. ciTy ma n aGe m e nT\nIn the City Management Phase, the first player takes one action \nwith each of their cities. A city may produce an item (such as a \nbuilding or unit card), devote itself to the arts to gain culture, or \nharvest a resource as its action (see pages 15\u201318).

The first player \nhas the first opportunity to perform those actions during the \nStart of Turn Phase. After the first player has performed all the \nstart of turn actions they wish to, play passes to the player\u2019s left, \nand the next player may then perform all of their desired start of \nturn actions, until all players have had a chance to do so.\nbu i lDi nG ne w ciTi e s\n\u201c A great city is not to be confounded with a populous one.\u201d\n\u2013Aristotle\nTo become a dominant civilization, a player\u2019s civilization must \nexpand geographically beyond its isolated, provincial origins. \nThe Building New Cities action enables a civilization to do so. \nThis action allows a player to construct a new city, which then \nlets them take more city actions each turn. \nDuring the Start of Turn Phase, if a player has fewer built cities \nthan their maximum number of cities (two normally, three if the \nplayer has researched the Irrigation tech), they may build one \nor more new cities on the map, provided that doing so does not \ntake the player above their maximum number of cities. To build \na new city, the player must first have a scout figure (representing \nsettlers) in each square that they wish to place a city marker in. \nIn addition, that square must meet the following requirements:\nThe square cannot be a water square.\u2022 \nThere must be eight revealed squares adjacent to the square \u2022 \n(i.e., no cities may be placed on the edge of the map or next to \na facedown map tile).\nThe square cannot be adjacent to a hut or village token (once \u2022 \nthe tokens are removed from the map, however, the squares \nthey were in/adjacent to become fair game).\nThe square cannot be adjacent to an enemy figure (either \u2022 \narmy or scout). Friendly figures may be adjacent, or even in \nthe same square as the scout.\nThe square must be at three squares or more away from \u2022 \nany other city marker, including diagonals (i.e., the city\u2019s \noutskirts must not overlap any other city\u2019s outskirts).\nIf these requirements are met, the player sacrifices the scout, \nremoving it from the board and returning it to their civilization \nsheet. Then, the player places a city marker on the space, \nunwalled side up. As mentioned earlier, this square is called the \nc i t y c e n t e r of the new city, and the eight squares adjacent to it \nare now the c i t y o u t s k i r t s.\nNote: The city center never generates anything. Its icons are \neffectively erased as long as the city marker remains. Only \nsquares in a city\u2019s outskirts provide icons and resources.\nIf there are any friendly figures in the square where a city \nis being built besides the scout being sacrificed, the player \nimmediately moves them to an adjacent square that they can \nlegally end their movement in.\nA city starts generating trade and production right away, so it \nproduces trade during this turn\u2019s Trade Phase (see page 14) and \nreceives an action during the City Management Phase (see pages \n15\u201318).\nCity Placement Example: On the diagram below, the green \nsquares are the only legal squares a new city can be built in. The \nred squares all mark sample illegal city placements. The reason \neach red square cannot have a city built in it is listed below.\nA\u2022  can\u2019t have a city built in it because it is a water square.\nB\u2022  is illegal because it is adjacent to the village token to its \nright (but would be legal once the village token is removed \nfrom that square).\nC\u2022  is adjacent to a facedown map tile.\nD\u2022  is adjacent to the green enemy army below it.\nE\u2022  is less than three squares away from the city above it.\n13\nA\n B\nC\nE\nD", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3775, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "c17bc973-11df-4f65-9f24-5ef70456a131": {"__data__": {"id_": "c17bc973-11df-4f65-9f24-5ef70456a131", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Sid Meier's Civilization  The Board Game Rulebook.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "8b69bf47-1b23-4e9c-a8e2-c0e4d8a21801", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "14", "file_name": "Sid Meier's Civilization  The Board Game Rulebook.pdf"}, "hash": "c292b58b6fbd01093f00695f4046e642240e797dbe692509a2ca3a297ce0e4f4", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "ch a nGi nG GOv e r n m e nTs\n\u201c A great wind is blowing, and that gives you either imagination \nor a headache.\u201d\n \u2013Catherine the Great\nA civilization\u2019s government reflects its character and its overall \ngoals, and over time, a civilization may pass through many \ntypes of government as its character changes. In this game, \ngovernment cards indicate what form of rulership a player\u2019s \ncivilization has. go v e r n m e n t s are special cards u n l o c k e d \n(see page 21) through tech cards that allow a player to focus on \ncertain strategies, usually to the detriment of other strategies. At \nthe start of the game, players have only unlocked the Despotism \ngovernment and begin with it in play. (Exception: Rome and \nRussia each have another government unlocked as well, which \nthey start the game with as their form of government.)\nOnce a player unlocks a new form of government during the \nResearch Phase as the result of learning a new tech, they may \nchange to that government during the Start of Turn Phase of \nthe following turn. To do so, they simply look through their \ngovernment deck, locate the corresponding government card, \nand place it with the appropriate side faceup on top of their \ngovernment deck. This change represents the fact that their \ncivilization has switched over to the new form of government.\nHowever, a player only has one opportunity to change directly to \na new government. If the player wishes to change to a different \ngovernment on any turn other than the turn immediately after \nunlocking that government, they must first change to the \nAnarchy transitional government. This special transitional \ngovernment represents the upheaval occurring in the civilization \nand prevents the player from taking an action with their capital \nthat turn. If a player\u2019s civilization is in Anarchy, they may \nchange to any other government they know during the Start of \nTurn Phase of the next turn after entering Anarchy.\nNote: Any ongoing benefits from a government, such as the \nabilities on Republic or the coin on Feudalism, only last while a \nplayer\u2019s civilization continues to be ruled by that government.\n2. Tr aDe\nThe following activities may be performed by the players during \nthe Trade Phase: collecting trade and negotiating and trading. \nPlayers may all perform these actions simultaneously to save \ntime.\ncOl l e cTi nG Tr aDe\nDuring the Trade Phase, each player tallies up all of the trade \nsymbols ( @ ) in the city outskirts of all of their cities and \nthen increases the trade dial on their civilization sheet by that \namount (up to a maximum of 27 trade). For example, if a player \nhas two cities, one with four trade symbols in its outskirts and \nthe other with eight trade symbols in its outskirts, that player \nincreases their trade dial by 12 on their civilization sheet. Unlike \nproduction (see page 15), trade may be saved from turn to turn if \nnot spent.\nNote: When increasing or decreasing the trade dial, make sure to \ncount the spaces marked \u201cI,\u201d \u201cII,\u201d \u201cIII,\u201d \u201cIV,\u201d and \u201cV.\u201d Although \nlabeled differently from the other values, these spaces must be \ncounted as usual. So, for instance, a player who gains three trade \nwhile at \u201c3\u201d on their trade dial would advance their dial to the \n\u201cI\u201d space rather than the \u201c7.\u201d\nscOuTs a nD blOc k aDe s\nScout figures have the ability to gather any trade symbols in the \nsquare they inhabit each turn.

To make war, a civilization needs armies, and these \narmies are built out of smaller forces, known as units. Unit cards \nrepresent specific units in an army. To produce a unit, a player \nchecks to make sure that the city\u2019s production is high enough to \nproduce the chosen type of unit, and then the player draws a unit \ncard at random from the appropriate deck and adds it to their \nstanding forces pile.\nArtillery, infantry, and mounted units are unlocked and able \nto be produced with a city\u2019s action from the start of the game, \nbut aircraft units require the player to know the Flight tech to \nproduce them. If a unit deck is empty, units of that type are not \navailable to be produced until some are killed and returned to the \ndeck. If players go through the entire deck of a type of unit and \narrive at units that have been returned faceup to the bottom of \nthe deck, they must turn the deck over and shuffle it. \nTo determine the production cost of a unit, the player looks at the \nmarket board to see how advanced their units of that type are. \nThe more advanced the unit, the more expensive it is.\nRank 1 artillery, infantry, or mounted units cost 5  \u2022 !  each.\nRank 2 artillery, infantry, or mounted units cost 7  \u2022 !  each.\nRank 3 artillery, infantry, or mounted units cost 9  \u2022 !  each.\nRank 4 artillery, infantry, or mounted units cost 11  \u2022 !  each.\nAircraft units always cost 12  \u2022 !  each (once unlocked).\nNote: Because advanced units are more expensive, it is most cost \neffective to produce the units while they are cheaper and then \nupgrade them (see page 21).\nprO Du c i nG bu i lDi nGs\nA civilization\u2019s buildings do more than simply house its citizens. \nThey are the sites of a civilization\u2019s industry, commerce, and \nlearning \u2013 all of which are invaluable to the civilization\u2019s \nsuccess.

For \nexample, the Colossus costs 15  !  normally, but only 10  !  if the \nplayer producing it knows the Metalworking tech.\nNote: Remember that cities cannot combine production to \nproduce an item. The entire cost for the wonder must be paid \nby a single city. Converting trade to production, using resource \nabilities, and using certain culture event cards can help a player \nincrease the amount of production a city generates.\nOnce the wonder has been produced, the player places \nthe wonder card faceup in front of them and places the \ncorresponding wonder token in the outskirts of the city that \nproduced the wonder.

At \nthe start of the game, a player\u2019s culture hand size is two, meaning \nthat they can only hold two culture event cards in hand at once. \nThis number may be increased by tech such as Pottery, however. \nAs mentioned before, if a player exceeds their culture hand size, \nthen they must immediately discard down to their hand size \nbefore any culture event cards may be played.

Great \npeople can be placed on any terrain except water, and if placed \non a building or wonder, that building or wonder is replaced, as \ndescribed on page 17.\nHowever, great people have one significant advantage over \nbuildings. If they are replaced (by having a building, wonder, \nor another great person placed in their square), they are held in \nreserve and returned to the player\u2019s civilization sheet instead of \nbeing discarded.

S. Eliot\nWarriors and explorers have surveyed their surroundings for \nas long as mankind has existed, from the earliest tribesman to \ntoday\u2019s modern traveler. Players\u2019 armies and scouts have their \nchance to travel the world during the Movement Phase. During \nthis phase, each player, in turn, may move all of their figures, \none at a time. Each figure may move up to a number of squares \nequal to its civilization\u2019s t r a v e l s p e e d. A civilization\u2019s travel \nspeed starts at two, but may be increased by learning tech such \nas Horseback Riding. Figures cannot move diagonally. Once a \nfigure has begun its move, it must complete its move before any \nother figure may move.\nmOv i nG GrOu p s a nD sTa c k i nG li m iT\nA player may move several of their figures as a group if they \nall begin the Movement Phase in the same square. Doing so \ncan offer extra strength in battle (see page 23) or allow armies \nto protect scouts (see page 20). Figures that begin in the same \nsquare are not required to move together.\nHowever, a civilization may never have more figures (armies and \nscouts combined) in a single square on the map than its s t a c k i n g \nl i m i t. Like travel speed, a civilization\u2019s stacking limit starts at \ntwo, but may be increased by learning tech such as Masonry .\ncrOs s i nG waTe r\nAt the start of the game, figures cannot enter water squares. \nHowever, acquiring certain techs can allow a civilization\u2019s \nfigures to do so. The Navigation tech allows a player\u2019s figures to \ncross water but not end their movement in a water square. This \nmeans that the player may not make any move that would result \nin a figure ending its move in a water square.\nCertain higher-level tech cards, such as Sailing , allow a player\u2019s \nfigures to both move through and end their movement on water \nsquares. Once a player knows one of these techs, they may \nignore water when moving and may place figures on water \nsquares when producing the figures.\nun e x p lOr eD ma p Ti l e s\nWhile a map tile remains facedown, figures cannot move onto or \nacross it for any reason, nor can the effects of any tech or culture \nevent card cross or affect any square on an unexplored map tile. \nEffectively, the squares on an unexplored tile do not exist.\nDi s cOv e r i nG un e x p lOr eD ma p Ti l e s\nA player may d i s c o v e r a facedown map tile by spending one \nsquare of movement when one of their figures is orthogonally \nadjacent to the facedown tile. Instead of the figure moving for \nthat square of movement, the map tile is turned faceup. It is \nthen oriented so that the arrow at the bottom of the tile points \naway from the tile that the figure is on.\nThe player then looks at the map tile for hut and village icons. \nOne random hut marker is drawn and placed facedown, without \nlooking at it, on each square with a hut icon on the map tile. \nIn addition, one random village marker is drawn and placed \nfacedown, without looking at it, on each square with a village \nicon on it on the map tile.\nFor example, the red army figure below spends one square of \nmovement to discover the facedown tile to its right.\nThe facedown tile is flipped faceup and oriented so that the \nwhite arrow on its edge points away from the tile that the red \narmy figure is on.\nAfter the tile is flipped over, the player draws a hut and a village \ntoken and, without looking at their other side , places them \nfacedown on the indicated squares on the tile.\n19", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3613, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7f0f2ff8-bd50-413c-be4e-b35f68cf0e0e": {"__data__": {"id_": "7f0f2ff8-bd50-413c-be4e-b35f68cf0e0e", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "Sid Meier's Civilization  The Board Game Rulebook.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "0f7324ed-0e31-4fdd-98f0-8b9d27de6702", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "20", "file_name": "Sid Meier's Civilization  The Board Game Rulebook.pdf"}, "hash": "61bf930c5d0d2a71104398c0cbfb43c9ff849a4c4f46e4fa19723348bf139a12", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "fabce7ee-f40e-413c-afad-95b7d86a1242", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "04b09dae97b335d093ee0d422fd71c6f7e63fd28a8aad4450c63bfed48ed2049", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "The diagram below shows how the white arrow should appear \nwhen exploring in any of the four directions from the center tile.\nex p lOr i nG huTs a nD vi l l aGe s\nScout figures cannot enter a square containing a hut or village \nmarker. An army figure that enters a square containing a hut \nor village marker must immediately end its movement and is \nconsidered to be exploring the hut or village.\nIf the marker is a hut, it is peacefully absorbed by the invading \ncivilization.

Hut markers have \nresources printed on their backs and may be spent like resource \ntokens taken from the market, except that they are returned to \nthe box after being spent, rather than being added to the market.\nIf the marker is a village, it attempts to repel the invading \ncivilization. The player to the left of the invading player \nbecomes the \u201cbarbarian player\u201d and draws one artillery, one \ninfantry, and one mounted unit from the respective decks (if \none or more of the decks are depleted, make up the difference \nfrom one of the other decks \u2013 barbarian player\u2019s choice).

If it \nshows a great person icon, the player discards the \nvillage marker and then gains a random great person. \nOtherwise, the village marker shows a resource and \nis placed facedown on the player\u2019s civilization sheet, \nwhere it acts like a hut marker, as explained above.\nIf the invading player loses the battle, the army figure that \nentered the square (or the entire group of figures, if a group \nof figures entered) is killed and is returned to the player\u2019s \ncivilization sheet. However, unlike losing a battle to another \nplayer, there is no additional penalty for the loss.\nTip: Attacking barbarians without some sort of advantage \nbeyond a player\u2019s starting units is a risky proposition. It\u2019s \nadvisable for players to build extra units, upgrade their units, \nattack with a group of army figures, or go in with an ace up their \nsleeve (such as the Metalworking tech and an iron token).\nen e m y fiGu r e s\nScouts cannot enter a square containing enemy figures.

If the square contains a mix of both enemy armies and \nscouts, a battle occurs, but if the losing side in the battle has any \nscouts in the square, they are killed along with the armies; loot is \nthen collected as normal.\nExample: An army enters a square containing two armies and \na scout.

A player needs at least 6 trade to research a level I \ntech. This threshold is indicated on the players\u2019 trade dials by \nreplacing the number 6 with a \u201cI\u201d to represent tech level I. It \ncosts an additional 5 trade for each level thereafter (11 for level \nII, 16 for level III, 21 for level IV, and 26 for level V). These \nhigher tech levels are marked on the trade dial in the same way.\nResearching a tech spends all of the player\u2019s remaining trade, \nno matter how much trade they had before researching. The \nonly exception to this rule is for players who possess coins. \nCoins allow a player to retain 1 trade after researching for \neach coin the player possesses.

For a full explanation of coins, see page 26.\nExample 1: A player wishes to research Sailing, a level II tech. \nLooking at the trade dial, they see that level II techs require at \nleast 11 trade. Fortunately, the player has 18 trade (and a legal \nspace on their tech pyramid), so they reduce their trade to 0 and \nlearn Sailing.\nExample 2: If the player from example 1 possessed four coins, \nthey would retain 4 trade after learning Sailing.\nTh e Te c h py r a m iD\nThe second requirement a player must meet to learn a new \ntech is to have a legal space in their tech pyramid to place the \nnew tech.

However, when a player learns a level II tech, \nit must be placed above two level I tech cards already in their \npyramid. Similarly, level III tech cards must be placed above \ntwo level II tech cards in their pyramid, and so on. Lower-level \ntech cards represent the foundation for higher-level techs.

The player whose army figure \nis entering the square is the a t t a c k e r, while the player whose \nfigure or city is being attacked is the d eFe n d e r. If the attacker \nis attacking a village, the player to the attacker\u2019s left becomes \nthe defender. Generally, the defender is placed at a slight \ndisadvantage in a battle, since the element of surprise is on the \nattacker\u2019s side. When a battle begins, the attacker and defender \ntake the following steps:\n1. as s e m b l i nG Th e baT Tl e fOr c e\nThe attacker and defender each shuffle their standing forces and \ndraw a number of unit cards equal to their Ba t t l e h a n d s i z e at \nrandom. A player\u2019s battle hand size starts at three and may be \nincreased in the following ways:\n+2 hand size for each friendly army figure in the square \u2022 \nbeyond the first (remember that players cannot exceed their \ncivilization\u2019s stacking limit) \n+1 hand size if governed by \u2022 Fundamentalism\n+3 hand size if defending a city or capital.\u2022 \nA unit card has four different sides, as shown below. Each side \nhas a unit name (A), military rank (B), strength value (C), trump \nsymbol (D), and unit type (E).\nA\nD\nE\nC\n B\nWhen using a unit card in battle, a player only uses the side \ncorresponding to the rank of their matching military tech \nmarker. For instance, if the player\u2019s mounted military tech \nmarker is set to rank 2 (the side with two stripes), that player \nonly pays attention to the rank 2 side of their mounted units \u2013 in \nthis case, the \u201cKnight\u201d side. For example, the unit below would \nhave a strength of 2:\nNote: The first three ranks of military tech are represented with \none, two, or three stripes, while the fourth rank is represented by \na star.\nAfter a player draws their battle force, they may wish to turn \ntheir cards so that each card is oriented such that the top edge is \nthe one they are using, as indicated by the unit\u2019s rank.

Thus, player B\u2019s unit would deal its 3 wounds \nfirst, killing the wounded unit before it could attack back, and \nwould survive the attack without suffering a single wound.\npl a y e r b\npl a y e r a\nTrump\nTip: Obviously, a player whose units are trumped frequently \nduring a battle is at a serious disadvantage. Players should \nobserve what units other players are producing and react \naccordingly.\nbaT Tl e ab i l iTi e s\nSome tech cards have resource abilities that are used during \nbattle. These abilities are always used before or after attacking \nan enemy front, never during \u2013 even if some of their effects may \nlast through an attack.\nai r c r a fT un iTs\nIf a player learns the Flight tech, they become capable of \nproducing aircraft units. Aircraft units are very powerful units \n(their strength ranges from 5 to 7) that cannot trump or be \ntrumped by any unit. This means that aircraft units reliably deal \ntheir damage, no matter what enemies they are faced with.\n4. re sOl v i nG Th e baT Tl e\nAfter both players have played all of their battle forces, the battle \nis over. First, all wounds are removed from the surviving units in \nthe battle. Then, each player tallies up the strength of all of their \nsurviving units, adding in the value of the combat bonus card (if \nthey have it). The player with the highest total wins the battle, \nwith ties going to the defender.\nwi n n e r\u2019s fiGu r e lOs s e s\nThe winner then loses one army figure in the square for every \ntwo units of theirs that were killed in the battle.

Frick\nAlthough a leader may have great ambitions for their \ncivilization, ultimately very little can be accomplished without \nthe industry of the people working with the bounty of the land to \ncreate a healthy economy. A player may acquire economic power \nin the form of coins \u2013 either coins printed on building markers \nand map tiles, or coin tokens placed on certain tech cards (such \nas Code of Laws) as a reward for accomplishing particular tasks.\nWhen a player gains a coin, they advance their economy dial. \nShould the player later lose the coin, their economy dial must be \nreduced accordingly.\nCoins have two primary effects. First, when a player researches \na tech, they may keep one trade for every coin they have. So, for \ninstance, a player with five coins would be left with five trade \nafter researching a tech. Coins do not allow a player to keep \ntrade after any event other than researching a tech. Therefore, \na player can still have their trade reduced below their number \nof coins when spending trade to rush production or when trade \nis taken after the loss of a battle. It should be noted that having \ncoins never increases a player\u2019s current trade \u2013 it merely allows \nthe player to retain the trade they have already accumulated.\nThe second major effect that coins have is that a player who \naccumulates 15 coins immediately wins the game with an \neconomic victory (see \u201cWinning the Game\u201d on page 22).\nOther abilities may be granted to a player by certain tech cards, \nsuch as Computers, based on the number of coins they have \naccumulated.\ncOi n s On Th e ma p\nCoins gained from squares on the map \u2013 whether from a natural \ngold deposit in the mountains or from a building placed in a \nsquare \u2013 are only kept as long as the player retains control of the \nsquare (i.e., the square is contained in the outskirts of one of the \nplayer\u2019s cities or one of the player\u2019s scouts remains in the square \nto gather from it). If an enemy figure blockades the square \ncontaining the coin, it is lost while the enemy figure remains \nthere (see page 27). Similarly, if a building granting a coin to a \nplayer is destroyed, the coin is lost.\ncOi n TOk e n s\nCoin tokens placed on a tech card as a reward for accomplishing \na certain task are treated just like coins on the map, except that \nthere is a maximum number of times a given task will provide a \ncoin token. Coin tokens advance the economy dial when gained \nand cannot be lost.\nscOuT GaTh e r i nG\nScouts are of vital importance to a player\u2019s civilization. One of \ntheir critical roles is to send home trade, production, culture, \ncoins, and resources from distant locations. Each turn, beginning \nthe turn after it was placed on the map, a scout gathers the \ncontents of the square it occupies. The player declares which of \ntheir cities the scout is \u201csending\u201d the square to during the Start \nof Turn Phase, and all of the icons in that square (including \ntrade, production, culture, coins, and resources) are then \nconsidered to be in that city\u2019s outskirts for the rest of the turn. \nConsequently, the city benefits from any trade, production, or \nother icons in the square for the turn.\nThe city above contains the following icons:\n3\n 5\nThus, it adds 3 @ to the red player\u2019s trade dial each turn during \nthe Trade Phase.

New Tech Cards, Military Reference Cards, and \nMetropolis Markers: Add the four new tech cards \nto each player\u2019s existing tech deck, and add the \nmetropolis markers to each player\u2019s city markers. The \nmilitary reference cards should be placed with each \nplayer\u2019s setup card.\n3. New Map Tiles, Hut and Village Markers, and Relic \nMarkers: Add the new home map tiles to those from \nthe core game and shuffle the new neutral map tiles in \nwith the other neutral map tiles. Then, add the hut and \nvillage markers to the markers from the core game. \nPlayers may also wish to store the relic markers with \nthe hut and village markers, since all of them are used \nwhen exploring the map.\n4. New Wonders and Culture Events: Shuffle the new \nwonder and culture event cards into their respective \ndecks. Note that players must build the wonder deck \nbefore each game, as described in the next column.\n5. Replacement Cards: Remove the old \u201cFlight\u201d and \n\u201cAngkor Wat\u201d cards from the core game, replacing \nthem with the new cards that came with this expansion.\n6. Fifth Player Components: Separate out the fifth \nplayer\u2019s plastic figures, cards, and markers to prepare \nthem for use. The five-player setup diagram can be \nfound on page 6.\n7.

The drawn card is \n\u201cArchimedes,\u201d a great scientist. However, there are no \nscientist great person markers left, so \u201cArchimedes\u201d is \ndiscarded faceup to the bottom of the great person deck. \nDrawing again, Rome receives \u201cSt. Francis of Assisi,\u201d \na great humanitarian. There are two humanitarian \ngreat person markers left, so Rome takes one of the \ntwo markers and places the \u201cSt. Francis of Assisi\u201d card \nfacedown next to their civilization sheet.\nNote: When the Greeks draw a great person, the Greek \nplayer draws until the player has two valid great person \ncards to choose between.\nIf the players go through the entire great person deck \nand a faceup card is revealed on top of the deck, turn \nthe deck over and shuffle it to create a new deck.\ngrEat pErson aBilitiEs\nThe abilities listed on great person cards are similar to \nthose on wonder cards, but are generally less powerful \nand are often usable only by discarding the card. Each \nability indicates when it can be used. When a player \nwishes to use a great person ability, the player turns \nthe card faceup, revealing it to the other players, and \nthen uses the ability. If the great person card must be \ndiscarded for the ability to be used, the player discards \nthe card faceup to the bottom of the great person deck; \notherwise, it remains faceup in front of its owner.\nNote: A player cannot use a great person\u2019s ability unless \nthey have at least one great person marker of that great \nperson\u2019s type on the map. For example, in order to use \nthe ability of \u201cWilliam Shakespeare,\u201d the player must \nhave at least one artist great person marker on the map.\nkilling grEat pEoplE\nWhen a great person marker is killed (normally by a \nculture event or the destruction of a city), the player \nmust check to see whether they now have too many \ngreat person cards of that type. A player may only have \none great person card for each great person marker of \nthat type they possess (including markers on the map \nand those held in reserve), regardless of whether the \ncards are faceup or facedown. Thus, a player with two \nartist great person markers may have no more than two \ngreat artist cards total. If a player has too many of the \nsame type of great person card, they must randomly \ndiscard cards of that type (one at a time) until they no \nlonger have too many.\nExample: Rome has two artist great person markers on \nthe map and possesses \u201cWilliam Shakespeare\u201d (faceup) \nand \u201cMichelangelo\u201d (facedown). Egypt plays a culture \nevent card that kills one of Rome\u2019s artist great person \nmarkers. Now, Rome has one too many great artist \ncards, so that player selects one of their two great artist \ncards at random without looking (\u201cMichelangelo,\u201d in \nthis case) and discards that card faceup to the bottom of \nthe great person deck. \n12\ngrEat pErson CarD BrEakDown\nA.

Social policies are \nrepresented by a set of four double-sided cards, and \nevery civilization begins the game with one set. Social \npolicies are always unlocked at the start of a game \n(i.e., no special tech is required to use them), but a \ncivilization cannot benefit from a social policy until it \nadopts it (see below).\naDopting soCial poliCiEs\nA civilization\u2019s social policy maximum  is equal to \nthe number of its built cities. Each time a civilization\u2019s \nsocial policy maximum increases, it must immediately \nadopt a new social policy. \nEach civilization begins the game with a social policy \nmaximum of 1, and should adopt a social policy in \nstep 1 of  Player Setup. (Exception: The French begin \nthe game with a social policy maximum of 2 and their \nsocial policy maximum is increased by 1). \nWhen a civilization adopts a new social policy, its \nplayer chooses a social policy card it does not currently \nhave and flips it to its desired side. After a civilization \nhas adopted a social policy, it cannot adopt another \nsocial policy from that same card (to use the reverse \nside of the card, the social policy must be switched).\nlosing soCial poliCiEs\nEach time a civilization\u2019s social policy maximum \ndecreases, its player chooses a social policy card it \ncurrently has and returns it to its pile of unused social \npolicies (any policy on the card can be re-adopted later).\nswitChing soCial poliCiEs\nNormally, after a social policy is adopted, it cannot \nbe changed. This makes the decisions of which social \npolicies to adopt very important.

Each player draws two secret objectives and chooses one to \nkeep. Shuffle the unchosen secret objectives back into the \nsecret objective deck without revealing them.\nii. Place the victory point track near the game board. As a group, \nplayers decide whether to play with the 10- or 14-space side \nof the victory point track faceup. Each player places one of his \ncontrol tokens on the \u201c0\u201d space of the track.\niii. The speaker deals five facedown stage I objectives and \nplaces them in a row above the victory point track. Then, he \ndeals five facedown stage II objectives and places them in a \nrow below the victory point track.\niv. The speaker reveals the first two stage I objectives.\nNOTE: For a five-player game, one additional system tile will be \nneeded. Before placing system tiles, the speaker draws one random \nred-backed system tile and places it faceup in any space adjacent to \nMecatol Rex.\niii. PLACE SYSTEM TILES:  First, players place their home \nsystems in the approximate positions where they will connect \nto the galaxy. Then, starting with the speaker and proceeding \nclockwise, each player places one system tile faceup in \nthe first ring around Mecatol Rex. After the last player has \nplaced his first tile, he places a second tile. Then, the order \nof tile placement reverses and proceeds counterclockwise, \nuntil it reaches the speaker again, who places two tiles. Then, \ntile placement reverses again and proceeds clockwise. This \nprocess repeats until players have placed all of their tiles.\nEach ring around Mecatol Rex must be fully built before \nany tile can be placed in the next ring. Anomaly system \ntiles cannot be placed next to one another unless there \nis no other option. Additionally, system tiles that contain \nthe same type of wormhole cannot be placed next to one \nanother unless there is no other option. After placing all of \nthe dealt system tiles, players attach their home systems to \nthe rest of the galaxy.\nNOTE: During a five-player game, three players will be at a slight \ndisadvantage based on their home systems\u2019 starting positions on the \ngame board. After creating the game board, those players receive \ntrade goods based on their positions. Use the diagram to the right to \ndetermine how many trade goods each of those players receives.\nSTEP 7\u2014PLACE CUSTODIANS TOKEN: Place the custodians \ntoken in the center of the game board on Mecatol Rex.\nSTEP 8\u2014SHUFFLE COMMON DECKS: Shuffle the action card, \nagenda, stage I objective, stage II objective, and secret objective \ndecks separately and place them in the common play area.\nSTEP 9\u2014CREATE SUPPLY: Gather and create separate piles in \nthe common play area for trade good tokens, fighter tokens, and \ninfantry tokens.\nSTEP 10\u2014GATHER STRATEGY CARDS: Place each of the eight \nstrategy cards faceup in the common play area within reach of  \nthe speaker.\nSTEP 11\u2014GATHER STARTING COMPONENTS: Each player gains \nthe starting technologies and starting units listed on the back of his \nfaction sheet. Each player places the technology cards faceup near \nhis faction sheet and the starting units in his home system. \nEach player places three command tokens in his tactic pool, three \ncommand tokens in his fleet pool, and two command tokens in his \nstrategy pool.\nGAME BOARD SETUP\nSIX-PLAYER SETUP\nFOUR-PLAYER SETUP THREE-PLAYER SETUP\nMECATOL REX\nHOME SYSTEM\nRING 1\nRING 2\nRING 3\nFIVE-PLAYER SETUP\n+2\n+2\n+4", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3462, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "ee6b9722-1734-4155-b566-8912a775477f": {"__data__": {"id_": "ee6b9722-1734-4155-b566-8912a775477f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Twilight Imperium  Fourth Edition Living Rules Reference.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "1b1e829f-8468-47ce-86db-a7114669f0f8", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "6", "file_name": "Twilight Imperium  Fourth Edition Living Rules Reference.pdf"}, "hash": "98c275e69ecec9a7b954374920772f1515034c2b66f49878b97bf77fada238a8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "6\n\u2022 After the last round of a combat, abilities that occur \u201cafter \na round of combat\u201d and \u201cafter combat ends\u201d occur during \nthe same timing window.

Players are \nencouraged to use the index on page 32 to find specific topics \nwithin the glossary.\n1 ABILITIES\nCards and faction sheets each have abilities that players can resolve \nto trigger various game effects.\n1.1 Each ability describes when and how a player can resolve it.\n1.2 If a card has multiple abilities, each ability is presented as its \nown paragraph.\n1.3 If an ability begins with a bolded \u201cAction,\u201d a player must use a \ncomponent action during the action phase to resolve that ability.\n1.4 If an ability uses the word \u201ccannot,\u201d that effect is absolute.\n1.5 When a player resolves an ability, he must resolve the ability \nin its entirety. Any parts of the ability preceded by the word \n\u201cmay\u201d are optional, and the player resolving the ability may \nchoose not to resolve those parts.\n1.6 Abilities on components that remain in play are mandatory \nunless they use the word \u201cmay.\u201d\n1.7 If an ability has multiple effects separated by the word \u201cand,\u201d a \nplayer must resolve as many of the ability\u2019s effects as possible. \nHowever, if he cannot resolve all of its effects, he is allowed to \nresolve as many as he can.\n1.8 COSTS\n1.9 Some abilities have a cost that is followed by an effect. The \ncost of an ability is separated from the effect by the word \u201cto\u201d \nor by a semicolon. A player cannot resolve the effect of such an \nability if he cannot resolve that ability\u2019s cost. \n1.10 Some examples of an ability\u2019s cost include spending resources, \nspending trade goods, spending command tokens, exhausting \ncards, and activating specific systems.\n1.11 TIMING\n1.12 If the timing of an ability uses the word \u201cbefore\u201d or \u201cafter,\u201d the \nability\u2019s effect occurs immediately before or after the described \ntiming event, respectively.\n\u2022 For example, if an ability is resolved \u201cafter a ship is \ndestroyed,\u201d the ability must be resolved as soon as the ship \nis destroyed and not later during that turn or round.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4491, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b831ca84-a558-4a10-a86e-c1868044ac9b": {"__data__": {"id_": "b831ca84-a558-4a10-a86e-c1868044ac9b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Twilight Imperium  Fourth Edition Living Rules Reference.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "6eeb62b1-861b-4551-ad8b-3b49fbaf0a5f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "7", "file_name": "Twilight Imperium  Fourth Edition Living Rules Reference.pdf"}, "hash": "33b16d3306cf401c527cf024fc04de5f3ee5bcd7694787c18c7e960d97f4e07d", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "7\n2.10 During the strategy and agenda phases, if two or more action \ncards or other abilities would be resolved during the same \ntiming window, players should use the timing rules on page \n4 to determine the correct order of resolution.\nRELATED TOPICS: Abilities, Component Action, Politics, Status \nPhase\n3 ACTION PHASE\nDuring the action phase, each player takes a turn in initiative order. \nDuring a player\u2019s turn, he performs a single action. After each \nplayer has taken a turn, player turns begin again in initiative order. \nThis process continues until all players have passed.\n3.1 During a player\u2019s turn, he may perform one of the following \nthree types of actions: a strategic action, a tactical action, or a \ncomponent action.\n3.2 If a player cannot perform an action, he must pass.\n3.3 After a player has passed, he takes no further turns and cannot \nperform additional actions during that action phase.\n\u2022 A player can still resolve transactions and \u201cat the start of \nyour turn\u201d abilities on the turn that he passes only.\n\u2022 A player that has passed can still resolve the secondary \nability of other players\u2019 strategy cards.\n\u2022 It is possible for a player to perform multiple, consecutive \nactions during an action phase if all other players have \npassed during that action phase.\n3.4 A player cannot pass until he has performed a strategic action.\n\u2022 During a three-player or four-player game, a player cannot \npass until he has exhausted both of his strategy cards.\n3.5 After all players have passed, play proceeds to the status phase.\nRELATED TOPICS: Component Action, Game Round, Status Phase, \nStrategic Action, Tactical Action\n4 ACTIVE PLAYER\nThe active player is the player taking a turn during the action phase.\n4.1 During the action phase, the player who is first in initiative \norder is the first active player.\n4.2 After the active player takes a turn, the next player in initiative \norder becomes the active player.\n4.3 After the last player in initiative order takes a turn, the player \nwho is first in initiative order becomes the active player again, \nand turns begin again in initiative order, ignoring any players \nwho have already passed.\nRELATED TOPICS: \nAction Phase, Initiative Order\n2 ACTION CARDS\nAction cards provide players with various abilities that they can \nresolve as described on the cards.\n2.1 Each player draws one action card during each status phase.\n2.2 Players can draw action cards by resolving the primary and \nsecondary abilities of the \u201cPolitics\u201d strategy card.\n2.3 When a player draws an action card, he takes the top card from \nthe action card deck and adds it to his hand of action cards.\n2.4 Each player can have a maximum of seven action cards in his \nhand at any time. If a player ever has more than seven action \ncards, he must choose which seven cards he wishes to keep and \ndiscard the rest.\n\u2022 A game effect can increase or decrease the number of cards \na player can have in his hand.\n2.5 A player\u2019s action cards remain hidden from other players until \nthey are played.\n2.6 The first paragraph of each action card is presented in bold \ntext and describes the timing of when that card\u2019s ability can \nbe resolved.\n\u2022 If an action card contains the word \u201cAction,\u201d a player must \nuse a component action during the action phase to resolve \nthe ability. A player cannot resolve a component action if he \ncannot completely resolve its ability.\n\u2022 Multiple action cards with the same name cannot be played \nduring a single timing window to affect the same units or \ngame effect. Canceled cards do not count as being played.\n2.7 To play an action card, a player reads and resolves the card\u2019s \nability text, making any decisions as prompted by the card. \nThen, he discards the card, placing it in the action discard pile.\n2.8 If an action card is canceled, that card has no effect and is \ndiscarded.\n2.9 During the action phase, if two or more action cards or other \nabilities would be resolved during the same timing window, \nplayers should use the timing rules on page 4 to determine \nthe correct order of resolution.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4064, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "bc8ac60f-069d-4a2e-97a3-d255b89bfe01": {"__data__": {"id_": "bc8ac60f-069d-4a2e-97a3-d255b89bfe01", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Twilight Imperium  Fourth Edition Living Rules Reference.pdf"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "338641f8-9179-4f6e-b0f3-7f48063ca39a", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "8", "file_name": "Twilight Imperium  Fourth Edition Living Rules Reference.pdf"}, "hash": "5510223c5103923180f853d9bf02db629177b219e66323a15151e3819433ba9c", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "8\n7.4 If a law is in a player\u2019s play area as opposed to the common \nplay area, that player owns that law.\n7. 5 If a law is discarded from play, that law\u2019s ability is no longer \nin effect.

To resolve \nthe agenda phase, players perform the following steps:\n8.2 STEP 1\u2014FIRST AGENDA: Players resolve the first agenda by \nfollowing these steps in order:\ni. REVEAL AGENDA: The speaker draws one agenda card \nfrom the top of the agenda deck and reads it aloud to \nall players, including all of its possible outcomes.\nii. VOTE: Each player, starting with the player to the left \nof the speaker and continuing clockwise, can cast votes \nfor an outcome of the current agenda.\niii.

Then, a new game round begins starting \nwith the strategy phase.\n8.5 VOTING\nWhen voting during the agenda phase, a player can cast votes for a \nspecific outcome of an agenda.\n8.6 To cast votes, a player exhausts any number of his planets. The \nplayer casts a number of votes for an outcome of his choice equal \nto the combined influence values of the planets he exhausted.\n\u2022 When a player exhausts a planet to cast votes, he must cast \nthe full amount of votes provided by that planet.\n5 ACTIVE SYSTEM\nThe active system is the system that is activated during a tactical action.\n5.1 When a player performs a tactical action, he activates a system \nby placing a command token from his tactic pool on that \nsystem. That system is the active system.\n5.2 A player cannot activate a system that already contains one of \nhis command tokens.\n5.3 A player can activate a system that contains command tokens \nthat match other players\u2019 factions.\n5.4 A system remains the active system for the duration of the \ntactical action during which it was activated.\nRELATED TOPICS: Movement, Tactical Action\n6 ADJACENCY\nTwo system tiles are adjacent to each other if any of the tiles\u2019 edges \nare touching each another.\n6.1 A system that has a wormhole is treated as being adjacent to a \nsystem that has a matching wormhole.\n6.2 A unit or planet is adjacent to all system tiles that are adjacent \nto the system tile that contains that unit or planet.\n\u2022 A system is not adjacent to itself.\n6.3 A planet counts as being adjacent to the system that contains \nthat planet.\nRELATED TOPICS: Movement, Neighbors, Wormholes\n7 AGENDA CARD\nAgenda cards represent galactic laws and policies. During each agenda \nphase, players cast votes for specific outcomes on two agenda cards.\n7.1 There are two types of agenda cards: laws and directives.\n7. 2 Laws can permanently change the rules of the game. \n7. 3 When resolving a law, if a \u201cFor\u201d outcome received the most \nvotes, or if the law requires an election, the law\u2019s ability \nbecomes a permanent part of the game.
